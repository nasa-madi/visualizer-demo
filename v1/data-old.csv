How might we minimize crash landing drones and air vehicles?,Wicked Wild,High,"Provide redundant landing capabilities to UAVs to increase safety and public confidence in these systems.

In the future, UAV's will be used in various environments to accomplish many tasks.

However, like any other machine, US will eventually fail or malfunction. When this happens, the vehicle has no control over where it lands or crashes.
So this video shows the test we performed terminating the vehicle mid flight in order to mitigate the risk of an uncontrollable UAV crashing into people, we'd like to propose a device which can steer the vehicle away from people or unsafe crash zones. I think the three steps to this number one, the vehicle will shut up. I'll pulsion so it becomes ballistic and follows a more predictable flight path to the onboard detect and avoid software will determine whether this crash zone is problematic. 3rd the detecting avoid software will determine the safest crash zone and finally a device will deploy to direct the crashing vehicle to the safest crash location. Clearly, the biggest question here is whether a device could be developed to actually affect the trajectory of an out of control vehicle. This will require analysis and testing to determine feasibility of this concept, and it'll be limited to vehicles under 55 pounds. We did investigate propulsion device options that would meet the physical requirements for the small US installation and gather real time or real world data on how much force they can impart for objects of various inertias. So here's our engineering approach. In order to address this problem, we'd like to use the phased engineering approach to solve this problem. Phase one would be hardware testing and data collection. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Phase two is vehicle simulation using phase one data to assess the impact of propulsive options on the trajectory management of the following vehicles. If results indicate feasible impact to the trajectory analysis of application to risk reduction technologies like grasp and real time risk assessment could be done. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Face you follow Phase three is validation testing with drop testing of objects with similar inertial characteristics as drones from the gantry with active propulsors to validate simulation runs. We believe this would have significant impacts on industries which require small UIS to integrate with them populated environments.

So the idea of this is that melanin it's ideally suited for energy harvesting applications, so if we could, you know, and as I show in a in the PowerPoint here, you know if we could coat the top surface or or part of a fuselage with basically melanin based energy harvesting panels and and convert that energy that impacts on those surfaces kind of like a solar cell for an airplane or a type of thing, then it could go into the electrical system of the aircraft and basically you know we know that you know in commercial aircraft you.
Know cost of operation and efficiency you know is is tremendous and so. You know the operators of commercial aircraft are looking for, you know, even fractional increases in efficiency. Uh to help generate and and maintain profitability as. So the wicket idea is to basically investigate a proof of concept melanin based energy absorber to produce electricity. The beauty of this concept is it's simplicity in which this can idea can be investigated. At this low TRL level, synthetic and organic melanin are commercially available through readily available sources. You could coat a substrate with a thin film of melanin and expose it to UV light, and then monitor that sample for the generation of electrical signal. Demonstrating some basic proof of concept that would set the stage for more formal research and development of melon and based energy absorbers for aeronautic applications."

","the context for today's presentation is that AI ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AIML systems remain very attractive targets for these kind of adversarial attacks. So industry has kind of been looking at this and we I put here some examples where an IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications. And similarly, a 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft and adversarial examples.
So the key idea here is that AI ML systems are vulnerable to these adversarial attacks across the entire life cycle of development, deployment and inference. So you know, the idea here is that there's this intersection of AI, ML, and cryptography, and there's many different kind of business sectors that live at this intersection.
And we can kind of leverage some of these enabling technologies from cryptography such as public key encryption, data signature, zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption. And there's all these other ones as well. And so the idea is that leveraging these kind of cryptographic primitives would enable us to build trust in systems and enforce good behavior as opposed to relying on trusting some entity or company or third party. So characteristics that build trust in these systems are that AI Mel systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy.
And that's a big key. Their privacy and that, you know, the idea here is that development of verifiable AIML standards and regulations that rely on these cryptographic guarantees can replace trusting companies.
So some simple examples just to give some intuition behind the ideas here is that you know, everybody's probably used open AI's chat GPT. So when you send a request to chat GPT, how do you know that the answer you get back is from the correct model?
So say that you're a subscriber to their premium service. You pay $10.00 a month to get access to chat GPT 4 when open AI returns their response. How do you know that they're running inference on chat GPT 4 as opposed to a cheaper model that might be more kind of profitable from a business perspective? Well, the answer is that you don't know you are putting trust in open AI to do the right thing. So some the examples here of different use cases are one that I just talked about here was the 2nd bullet, which is proof of inference. So the idea there is that, you know, you can leverage some of these cryptographic tools to validate or verify that you ran inference on the correct model. Some other use cases are, you know, let's say a company says, hey, I have some machine learning model, it was this accurate. How do you how do you verify that their performance on some data set is what they claim, while in both those situations you can use these cryptographic tools called 0 knowledge proofs?
There's other tools that you can use, such as fully homomorphic encryption, that enable privacy preserving mill so you can do the idea there is you can encrypt data, send to a large data center, do compute on your encrypted data and get back the answer that you had to begin with. And then now there's some other ideas about kind of by hardware attestation and provenance to ensure integrity of data that are running through your pipelines. So ultimately the wicked wild idea here is that cryptographic primitives can be combined with a aiml development and applications to provide strong guarantees across data pipelines, model development, model validation and inference while maintaining privacy.",,"Problem Title: Vulnerability of AI and ML Systems to Adversarial Attacks

How might we improve airborne communication with Vortex Beam Communication for Interference Mitigation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity:
Desirability: We are addressing the spectrum scarcity problem in the context of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).
Viability: Our solution makes use of a spatial filtering technique, which we are currently demonstrating in the laboratory under an existing NASA project aimed at low Earth orbit (LEO) to terrestrial communication.
Feasibility: Adoption of our method will require some changes to communication infrastructure; however, the ability to communicate in the presence of in-band interference could change the paradigm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication standards.
Key Use Cases: Any case involving line-of-sight communication links that cannot take advantage of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, which rely on multipath propagation.
Possible Partnerships: Florida International University, University of Akron, Xadite Perceptions, Department of Defense (DoD)

“Wicked-Wild” Idea:
Exploit the orthogonality of vortex beams to allow for simultaneous usage of specific portions of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
Isolate data channels using spatial-domain filtering techniques as opposed totraditional frequency-filtering techniques.
Increase data transfer volume by using multiple vortex beams of the same carrier frequency.
","thank you so advanced air mobility or ATM is the future of air transportation that explores the development of new technologies to revolutionize airspace usage and is a rapidly developing field that will include low altitude passenger transport, cargo delivery and public service capabilities. However, because the radio spectrum is a limited resource to increase of aircraft in the air, space raises concerns about potential interference with aviation communication.
This increased disruption of critical communication and navigation signals can be caused by a variety of factors, both internal and external, to aviation systems.
In severe cases, radiofrequency or RF interference caused by unintentional emissions or deliberate jamming can lead to important safety risks.
Here is how vortex beam communication stands as a promising solution to interference mitigation in the context of AM are are at vortex harnesses, an underutilized property of radio waves.
Their orbital angular momentum or OEM, the angular momentum of an of an electromagnetic or yam wave is composed of two parts, spin angular momentum corresponding to depolarization of the emwave and orbital angular momentum OAM associated to the spatial distribution of the EM wave. This integer value defines the number of helical terms the wavefront makes around the propagation axis.
By tailoring the antenna ray to generate a desired oil mode, say plus one, we can transmit a targeted beam.
Only receiver is equipped to detect the plus one mode will be able to decode the information.
Now visualized data traveling on an invisible highway for each lane is defined by distinct helical twist in the signal itself.
This twist, characterized by the OEM, forms the foundation for a powerful technique known as spatial multiplexing, which allows for the transmission of multiple independent data streams on the same frequency.
By utilizing the spatial domain, we overcome interference limitations inherent to current RF systems.
The orthogonality of OAM modes unlocks a dramatic increase in data capacity for applications previously limited by bandwidth constraints.
But beyond share capacity Re Vortex offers unique addressing capabilities.
Each OEM mode has a specific topological charge acting as its unique identifier or fingerprint.
Imagine beams with charges, for example plus one and -2.

In crowded environments with many RF signals.
OEM filtering allows receivers to focus on their specific OEM fingerprint, ignoring irrelevant signals and thus reducing interference while enabling targeted information delivery with high signal to noise ratio and accuracy.
Overall, encoding data on OEM modes consists of an information signal modulating the electric field of the RF wave.
By carefully manipulating the phase distribution across the wavefront, thus creating specific OEM modes carrying the encoded data, the then multiple OEM modes carrying different data streams can be superimposed and transmitted together.
Specialized antenna arrays at the receiving end can then separate these modes based on their unique face patterns, all of which makes this vortex beam communication technology hold the key to reshaping the way the data is transferred and interference mitigated in a soon to be crowded airspace.",,,,,,
How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation.

Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.
It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.
it is the importance into the air and contributing to global warming, the high energy efficiency of fuel may offset the lower energy density of hydrogen.

"Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST)",Wicked Wild,High,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science/engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.
What if…we could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by
 improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety, and efficiency using lightweight polymer aerogels
Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage
Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy
","So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten.
It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks.
So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport.
This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.

Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95% large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly.
You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft.",,"Problem Title: Safely, compactly, and economically storing H2 as an aviation fuel.

Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle.
Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e.
Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation.
Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen.
You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical.
It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal.
Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery.
You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire.

So how can we use this this national priority area, which is to develop quantum technology for benefits within within aeronautics and have aeronautics be partly an enabler to to to getting greater benefit from quantum technology. So the right now there are billions that are being invested yearly for in the reason is quantum technology has potential groundbreaking and economic and national security impacts. Quantum computing can be used to develop new materials, or they can be it can be used for medicine development and because of the because you can get an improved quantum chemistry calculations. We NASA aeronautics could potentially use it for secure app security applications and also for perhaps doing improved CFDS CFD calculations so it can be an economic game changer. And so it's something that that the nation is fully, you know, invested in and trying to develop this technology.
Now my assertion is is that if you really if if there is a ground breaking, you know new medicine developed, everybody's gonna wanna get out of quantum computer and do material development or groundbreaking you know new information developed through CFD or something like that.
People are going to want to get access to it. They're going to want to have the ability to do things that are new and just haven't been possible before. So in order to do that, you kind of need a quantum network, just like the Internet up until now. Folks will say that you can right now you can log in onto a quantum computer, and that's true. You can log in and you can utilize IBM's Quantum computer, but if the quantum computer is really doing something groundbreaking, then you want to have the ability to access that and not even know and not even the owner of the quantum computer can know what you're doing. If you're, if you're developing a new medicine, you wouldn't want to log into a quantum computer, and then whoever's running it, be able to know what that is. So there are ways of doing that, like blind quantum computing when you utilize entanglement utilizing quantum network to connect the researcher to the quantum computer or the quantum resource that you want to utilize. So the in order to do that, it is quantum communication is notoriously hard. You can't amplify it because you you need to stay at the quantum level and one of the and there are a number of other agencies. NSF DOE working towards uh interconnecting quantum nodes through fiber optic networks. The problem is nobody's working on something greater than a metro scale quantum network, and the reason is is because of the loss in the the fiber. You would end up having to place lots and lots of quantum computer quantum repeaters to get long distances. One of the things that you can do though is once you get out to about 50 to 100 kilometers, you realize that there's a benefit to going free space and doing free space interconnection. So my suggestion here is that we research developing quantum connectivity through arrow nodes so that we can expand the benefits from quantum technology and it quantum and free space communication does have an inherent advantage over what we can do with fiber optics. lastly, if we develop a quantum connectivity we can use it for security quantum key distribution, authentication, all sorts of things there.",,,,,,

So in order to do that, you kind of need a quantum network, just like the Internet up until now. Folks will say that you can right now you can log in onto a quantum computer, and that's true. You can log in and you can utilize IBM's Quantum computer, but if the quantum computer is really doing something groundbreaking, then you want to have the ability to access that and not even know and not even the owner of the quantum computer can know what you're doing. If you're, if you're developing a new medicine, you wouldn't want to log into a quantum computer, and then whoever's running it, be able to know what that is. So there are ways of doing that, like blind quantum computing when you utilize entanglement utilizing quantum network to connect the researcher to the quantum computer or the quantum resource that you want to utilize. So the in order to do that, it is quantum communication is notoriously hard. You can't amplify it because you you need to stay at the quantum level and one of the and there are a number of other agencies. NSF DOE working towards uh interconnecting quantum nodes through fiber optic networks. The problem is nobody's working on something greater than a metro scale quantum network, and the reason is is because of the loss in the the fiber. You would end up having to place lots and lots of quantum computer quantum repeaters to get long distances. One of the things that you can do though is once you get out to about 50 to 100 kilometers, you realize that there's a benefit to going free space and doing free space interconnection. So my suggestion here is that we research developing quantum connectivity through arrow nodes so that we can expand the benefits from quantum technology and it quantum and free space communication does have an inherent advantage over what we can do with fiber optics. lastly, if we develop a quantum connectivity we can use it for security quantum key distribution, authentication, all sorts of things there.",,"Problem Title: Mobility Challenges for Senior Citizens

Problem: As people age, their ability to drive safely can often decrease due to factors such as declining vision, slower motor reflexes, or cognitive impairments. This can lead to a reduction in mobility, making it difficult for senior citizens to maintain their independence and carry out essential activities such as grocery shopping, attending medical appointments, or visiting family and friends.","Solution Title: Self-Driving Vehicles: Enhancing Mobility for Senior Citizens

Solution: Self-driving vehicles could significantly improve the quality of life for senior citizens by addressing their mobility challenges. These vehicles could provide safe and reliable transportation, allowing seniors to travel freely without the need for a driver’s license or the ability to drive. This would enable them to maintain their independence and continue participating in their communities. Additionally, self-driving vehicles could be equipped with features specifically designed for seniors, such as easy entry and exit, voice control, and health monitoring systems. This technology could also reduce the risk of accidents caused by human error, providing a safer travel option for seniors.",,,
"How are prisons and their population susceptible to climate change conditions and if so what are the implications wrt moving them, saving them, etc?",GeoEngineering,Low,,,,"Problem Title: The need for prison reform

Problem: Prisons and their populations are highly susceptible to climate change conditions. The link between the climate crisis and the need for prison reform is rarely acknowledged, but it’s a significant issue. Rising temperatures can lead to harsh conditions inside prisons, contributing to health risks for the incarcerated population. Many prisons lack adequate air conditioning, leading to heat-related illnesses and even deaths. Furthermore, prisoners are often subject to poor conditions, overcrowding, and are at risk of food and water shortages, with little means to cope with increasingly extreme weather events.","Solution Title: Prison reform

Solution: Addressing the impact of climate change on prisons and their populations requires a multi-faceted approach. This could include improving the infrastructure of prisons to better handle extreme weather conditions, such as installing air conditioning systems and ensuring access to clean water. Additionally, policies could be implemented to reduce overcrowding and improve living conditions within prisons. In the face of extreme weather events, contingency plans could be developed for the safe evacuation and relocation of prisoners. Long-term solutions might involve reconsidering the current approach to incarceration, taking into account the increasing challenges posed by climate change.

Solution Title: Aviation as a Bridge to Rehabilitation and Reintegration

Solution: Aviation could play a significant role in prison reform by facilitating access to rehabilitation and reintegration programs. For instance, aviation could be used to transport professionals such as therapists, educators, and job trainers to remote prisons. This would allow inmates to receive the support they need to successfully reintegrate into society after their release. Additionally, aviation could be used to transport inmates to facilities that offer specialized programs not available in their current location. This could include programs for substance abuse treatment, mental health services, vocational training, and more. By bridging the geographical gap, aviation could contribute to more effective and inclusive prison reform.",,,

How might we democratize the Medical Supply chain through aviation? 
How might we regulate drones/democratized aviation in the future medical supply chain? 
Why is this a problem? 
The use of drones, or unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics has a range of potential strengths: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. However, large numbers of drones may affect other aircraft operating in the same local airspace, the infrastructure for the introduction of a significant number of drone systems does not exist, and there are significant number of regulatory and safety issues involved. Lack of technical expertise within regulating bodies on these subjects. And, there are a couple of real technological barriers that are wicked hard and nobody has tackled them [REF - The Big Case for Small UAS Access to the National Airspace System.pdf (sharepoint.com)]. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
UTM (Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management) system is being developed by NASA and FAA to safely and efficiently integrate drone operations into the national airspace system where other vehicles also fly. Increasing the capability of individual drones towards more complete on-board situational awareness to avoid safety hazards or impact to the airspace can shift the problem from one of centralized management to one of self-managed systems that do not require human intervention. SBIR (GH). 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
More advanced management capabilities of the air space will allow improved safety and efficiency. Technology development of drone and vehicle artificial intelligence, autonomy, internal/external vehicle situational awareness can impact drone capabilities on an individual level. Overall, the introduction of drones into the air space will change the nature of the airspace and begin the early phase of addressing these individual drone operational challenges 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?

"How might the entire aviation experience be restructured to reduce its risk as a vector of pathogen transmission? (reducing unnecessary contact, etc.)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Why is this a problem? 
The drive to reduce human interaction in aviation has at least 2 influencing factors: The attempt to safeguard public health from the spread of contagions; and an economic drive towards automation to decrease staffing and expense associated with airline and the airport employees. However, this can lead to the depersonalization of air travel and, depending on the efficiency of the automation, potential inefficiencies in handling customer complaints/problems as well as removing a public face representing and individual airline company.

If the aviation industry is a major vector for pathogen transmission, it will continue to generate global pandemics as strict border control will be more porous than otherwise. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?
At the very least, the interactions of automated system should be at least as efficient as human based customer service. This implies improved artificial intelligence be implemented so that either unexpected events can be addressed or quickly re-routed to human staffing.
Additional interfaces need to be designed to be pathogen resistant in case cleaning is less effective or skipped.
Standard, practiced changes to routing and operations if pathogens are detected or a higher risk of transmission.
Additional changes to cabin design to mitigate risk.
Airport redesign to reduce transmission while waiting in line, etc.

This drive to minimize staffing and increase automation in customer service is already happening across multiple industries. Increasing automation and autonomous systems may result in airports in which the process is fully automated and one does not have to interact with a member of the airline or airport staff in order to board the plane. 
(Passenger to Passenger) Use of masks and availability of sanitizing wipes or fluids, post COVID, will set cultural norms to reduce P2P transmission.

Wickedness? CAS-worthy?
This may be a technological progression that will first be implemented in the range of other industries before it reaches aviation. This may not be CAS-worthy problem because the market is already addressing automation (for costs).
But from the pathogen side and from the in-the-tube spread, automation doesn’t account for all interactions and may not even shield people from the most common mechanisms of pathogen transmission (because we don’t know what they are). From that perspective, CAS may have an valid entry point. There may be aircraft design and technology investments specific to the aircraft that may be worthwhile IF the pathogen transmissions is validated as a big problem. (See Capabilities list). ",,,,,,,

Why is this a problem? 
Large portions of the US population, particularly those with the greatest health challenges, do not participate in clinical research studies and thus do not benefit from those discoveries. Low accrual issues overall are the cause of 55% of terminated clinical trials. This lack of representation compromises generalizability, hinders innovation, impacts trust in the medical system, and compounds health disparities of communities without access. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Often, clinical trials are centered around academic or research institutions limiting participation by a broader sampling of the population. Capabilities to address this problem revolve around improving the ability for patients to participate, or, effectively, bringing the clinical trial to the patients. 
For example, travel impacts out-of-pocket costs to patients, typically driving remote patients out of studies. Distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established as a cause of lack participation by rural communities. 
Thus, one capability to improve participation would be to increase the accessibility to transportation in rural communities. 
Further, telemedicine and virtual or localized trial treatments may broaden the geographic diversity. 
While some aspects of this transformation are more related to overall trends in health care technology, the ability to provide well equipped mobile airborne laboratories could impact the ability to increase participation in clinical trials in rural communities. 
Beyond issues related to location, there is in general a lack of participation by racial and ethnic minority populations for a variety of socio-economic reasons. Specific outreach may be required to these populations, so investment in greater capabilities in community coordination. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation to allow more democratized transportation and the ability to bring more comprehensive health care capabilities, including clinical trial participation, no I don’t to remote regions; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care.

Very High - 1 Billion 
US Participation was 28% of the total representation in global Clinical trials in 2015. The problem in the US is also then a global representation problem. With personalized genetic mods, medicine, this will become worse. With Climate change, disease and medical impacts will also worsen in the most distressed areas and populations (not currently studied). Specific rural communities are impacted by this problem already within the US. For example, distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations who are more likely to live far away from research centers. 
Academic centers conduct 55% of the NIH extramural research and operate 98% of the cancer centers. Participation in these activities is biased by the proximity to these centers. However, more broadly, effective clinical trials as a method for improved treatment and drug development has an impact on the population as a whole. Limiting the effectiveness of these trials because of a lack of participation by significant population subgroups narrows the trial’s impact and reduces benefits to society beyond the immediate drug and research.

Problem Scoping: 
Two divergent Healthcare Scenarios: 
Medical treatments become cost-effective enough to move to or stay in local hospitals, lessening the need for travel. 
Medical treatments become less cost-effective (or some do) to the point that treatment centers consolidate and are farther away from patients on average. This is the more likely scenario given the trends in health-apps, investing, travel nurses, minute-clinics, hospital funding problems. 
Given scenario (2), there are two Aviation Scenarios: 
Personal Air mobility or commercial aviation drops in cost sufficiently to counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Medical treatment (tools/supplies) become small enough and cheap enough to ship TO the patient, possibly by air (air hospital?) and counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Sub Problems: 
Does the shift to outpatient clinics reduce the availability of hospitals offering complex procedures and put greater need on air travel for the critically ill? 
Population is more distributed (remote work), so will more people be farther away from centralized services that cannot be financially solvent in closer facilities? 
Will the advancement or cost-efficiency of treatments drop enough to distribute healthcare to local clinics? 
Why is this a problem? 
As medical health care technology becomes more advanced, the cost of health care more expensive, and population more widely distributed, aviation may have an increasing effect on the accessibility of health care. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Aviation can provide services in the future that are presently either centralized or provided by a range of other transportation. The challenge will be to right-size and optimize the aviation capability to the needs of the health care problem. 
Transportation of medicine via UAVs with appropriate temperature/atmosphere/humidity control which can provide timely delivery, 
Airborne ambulances that can transport while providing care. 
Transportation of medical equipment to remote areas (on a rotation? As part of a pre-planned schedule?). 
Miniaturization of health tech 
More temp-stable medical goods that can survive rougher transport. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation ranging from the advent of personalized air vehicles to package delivery UAVs allowing a series of options for both human and package delivery; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. These trends are counterbalanced by ever increasing healthcare costs that may limit patient access. 
Telehealth – making people more comfortable with remote healthcare 
Robotic Telehealth – letting doctors stay where they are but keep robots local for surgery, etc. 
Cheaper diagnostics - reducing the need for travel to find out if you have a problem, reserving travel to treatment.’ 
Medical Tourism – will the cost and accessibility of medical tourism counterbalance the need for rural access. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
This is ANOTHER way that discrepancies between rural vs urban healthcare is mitigated by aviation. We scoped this to 100M because we believe that smaller procedures will become more accessible/local, but not ALL procedures. So globally, we believe that 100M people will be impacted or make decisions about treatment and safety based on access and cost. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? 
Score: 4-5 Majority 4 (given the costs and advanced nature of the treatments), but small percentage will be 5s, where care is absolutely critical to immediate survival. 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
We are assuming that the geographic consolidation of healthcare continues to the point that access is reduced. If that trend continues, we are confident aviation will be a greater player in access. If not, the question is moot. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy? 
It is suggested that this is a CAS-worthy problem. It is Wicked covering technical, political, societal, economic, and legal issues. It directly involves aerospace across the spectrum of vehicles. The range of technical challenges related to this topic are formidable spanning the range of NASA technologies. Other players in the market may influence parts of the system, but no one technology or solution can mitigate the entire issue of rural access. ",,,,,,,
"How might aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to heavy metal manufacturing and usage? (advanced manufacturing, airport safety protocols, and aircraft design)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Sibling Question: 
How will aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to increased usage of antimicrobials in response to COVID-19? (airport safety protocols, and aircraft design) 
Why is this a problem?
Drug resistant bacteria is propagated by the use of heavy metals (lead, mercury, and silver) because of mining and transportation usage. Bacteria have evolved to resist the presence of these heavy metals, producing traits that also shield them from antibiotics. 
Normally heavy metals are lethal to bacteria because of the free emission of ions that disrupt cell functions. 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health and development threat. It requires urgent multisectoral action in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
WHO has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. 
Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. 
Lack of clean water and sanitation and inadequate infection prevention and control promotes the spread of microbes, some of which can be resistant to antimicrobial treatment. 
The cost of AMR to the economy is significant. In addition to death and disability, prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays, the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted. 
Without effective antimicrobials, the success of modern medicine in treating infections, including during major surgery and cancer chemotherapy, would be at increased risk.

Improper cold chain handling - 50% of all temp excursions due to airport handling – drive medical costs 
Lost opportunity for aviation industry to participate in the medical products transport chain. Lack of standardization across the aviation industry has seen the medical cargo transportation sector losing out to other modes of transportation, such as road and sea. 
This can be addressed by restoring reliability and safety across the medical cargo supply chain. 
The primary issue is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive medical cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
The whole supply chain in the air cargo industry involves a lot of handling points of the cargo. 
There are a lot of different stakeholders that handle the cargo and each individual link in the chain needs to be up to standard, otherwise the whole quality of the supply chain can be lost.

But despite an increasing demand for transporting medicine worldwide, the sector has been falling behind other modes of transportation such as shipping or road, due to a lack of compliance, standardization, accountability and transparency across the supply chain. The air cargo share of global pharma products transport has declined from 17% in 2000 to 11% in 2013, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) notes. 
The reason behind the decline is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
Over 50% of all temperature excursions occur while products are in the hands of airlines and airports, according to IATA, which renders the products worthless or even dangerous for patients. 
However, according to the Seabury Group, just 0.5 million tonnes of pharmaceutical products are transported by air every year, compared to 3.5 million tonnes by sea. 
Annual product losses associated with these problems range from $2.5-$12.5bn, a figure that IATA describes as “unacceptably high in a $300 billion a year market”.** _ 
The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50% of vaccines are wasted globally every year; a large part because of lack of temperature control and the logistics to support an unbroken cold-chain. 
At the scale of COVID-19, this spoilage rate could waste potentially a billion vaccines, which, even if valued at a non-profit cost of around $10 a vaccine, represents a staggering wasted investment. 
Cracking the cold chain challenge is key to making vaccines ubiquitous (theconversation.com) 
The vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, is often used as the key metric for global vaccination coverage because it is a good indicator for access to routine immunization services. 13.5 million children were not vaccinated in 2018.

The overall impact varies depending on the type of transport. Related to emergency transport and care, the population may be limited and more concentrated in rural areas. However other forms of medical transport are much more common. For example, professional transport a patient from one health care facility to another is a relatively common occurrence within parameters dictated by legal and health insurance regulations.

What is the problem or need?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances generate an environment of ubiquitous monitoring both on a personal and societal level. 
Personal health monitoring: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level. Privacy concerns arise related to use of personal information
Wearables hacking - how can we trust the data and protect the users?
There are also remote medical sensing technologies that could be as ubiquitous as CCTV, and even drone-mounted.
NASA's Aeronautics technologies can enable persistent, wide-area coverage of climate-related parameters and NASA's Earth observing satellites add to the data gathering.
Such sensing capabilities enable new opportunities to provide actionable information, detect problems and improve life, while at the same time imply severe ethical issues if misused.

Improved sensing capabilities in & above the water / ice caps.
Implementation of Big Data management of the ubiquitous sensing networks in an equitable manner resulting in high quality results.
What trends are driving this capability or need that may influence the problem or solution space?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances that allow ubiquitous monitoring, combined with Big Data processing and communications, means that the infrastructure structure for Ubiquitous Sensing both on a personal and societal level already exists.
Economic drivers are moving towards use of monitoring technologies to drive specific outcomes, not necessarily for the benefit of the population.
Privacy concerns are declining among younger generations: decline in need for privacy with respect to certain areas of life may allow wearables to be used to communicate more broadly as part of IoT using cloud
TinyML may enable wearables to be powerful computers, recommendation engines
Broad sensing system capabilities are both becoming more pervasive and more easily implemented enabling a new level of monitoring and surveillance.

These global challenges and opportunities touch everyone, yet they disproportionately impact communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which often bear the brunt of climate change effects and are least equipped to adapt to or influence AI and surveillance technologies.

Imagine a coastal community in one such LMIC. The rising sea levels, a direct consequence of climate change, threaten their homes and livelihoods. However, their voices are often unheard in international climate policy discussions. Their limited resources and access to technology make it hard for them to adapt to these changes or participate in mitigation efforts.

Meanwhile, the world around them is becoming increasingly digital. AI systems are transforming economies, Surveillance technologies are becoming ubiquitous, and wearable devices that could help detect and warn of disasters are out of their reach due to economic constraints. These communities are at risk of being left behind or, worse, exploited as the world around them transforms.

This scenario is not just a possibility but a reality for many communities around the world today. The ethical impact of these changes is significant and global, affecting billions of people. The aviation industry is uniquely positioned to influence these challenges, from contributing to climate change mitigation to leveraging AI for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.

However, there are significant gaps in understanding and addressing these problems. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of AI and surveillance technologies are equitably distributed and do not infringe on human rights. We also need to involve the most affected communities in climate change solutions and ensure their voices are heard.

The potential impacts of these issues are well known, but the specific outcomes and how they will evolve are uncertain. As we navigate this future, we must be proactive in addressing these ethical considerations and strive for a world that is not only technologically advanced but also equitable and inclusive.",,,"Problem Title: Physical Water Scarcity: This occurs when a region’s demand for water exceeds the limited water resources available there.

How might we minimize crash landing drones and air vehicles?,Wicked Wild,High,High,"Provide redundant landing capabilities to UAVs to increase safety and public confidence in these systems. This will allow the economy to expand with the capabilities UAVs promise while managing the risks associated with their overflight of valuable assets and humans. We can take the next step to build on the success of Safe2Ditch intelligent landing system by adding backup propulsion and guidance to increase the options for a safe ditching and more precisely control the crash and mitigate damage/injury. Perform a analysis of available electric, pressure, 
and rocket powered systems that can be added to drones to supplement 
damaged systems and controlled by the Safe2Ditch system to expand its 
ability to reduce the danger from ditching UAVs","Today I'd like to propose rails, which is retro assisted intelligent landing study. In the future, UAV's will be used in various environments to accomplish many tasks. These environments will have people present, and this presents at risk because of the risk NASA has developed detecting the void software to recognize unsafe situations and avoid landing in these zones. However, like any other machine, US will eventually fail or malfunction. When this happens, the vehicle has no control over where it lands or crashes.
So this video shows the test we performed terminating the vehicle mid flight in order to mitigate the risk of an uncontrollable UAV crashing into people, we'd like to propose a device which can steer the vehicle away from people or unsafe crash zones. I think the three steps to this number one, the vehicle will shut up. I'll pulsion so it becomes ballistic and follows a more predictable flight path to the onboard detect and avoid software will determine whether this crash zone is problematic. 3rd the detecting avoid software will determine the safest crash zone and finally a device will deploy to direct the crashing vehicle to the safest crash location. Clearly, the biggest question here is whether a device could be developed to actually affect the trajectory of an out of control vehicle. This will require analysis and testing to determine feasibility of this concept, and it'll be limited to vehicles under 55 pounds. We did investigate propulsion device options that would meet the physical requirements for the small US installation and gather real time or real world data on how much force they can impart for objects of various inertias. So here's our engineering approach. In order to address this problem, we'd like to use the phased engineering approach to solve this problem. Phase one would be hardware testing and data collection. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Phase two is vehicle simulation using phase one data to assess the impact of propulsive options on the trajectory management of the following vehicles. If results indicate feasible impact to the trajectory analysis of application to risk reduction technologies like grasp and real time risk assessment could be done. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Face you follow Phase three is validation testing with drop testing of objects with similar inertial characteristics as drones from the gantry with active propulsors to validate simulation runs. We believe this would have significant impacts on industries which require small UIS to integrate with them populated environments. The outcome of this work could inform the FA on beyond visual line of sight flights and rules regarding autonomous systems.",,,,
How might we harvest energy and shield against radiation with melanin?,Wicked Wild,Medium,High,"Commercial aircraft use about 100 MW of electricity. All that electricity must be generated by the aircraft. This require converting fuel to electricity that results in a reduction of aircraft efficiency.

How might we improve airborne communication with Vortex Beam Communication for Interference Mitigation?,Wicked Wild,High,High,"Opportunity:
Desirability: We are addressing the spectrum scarcity problem in the context of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).
Viability: Our solution makes use of a spatial filtering technique, which we are currently demonstrating in the laboratory under an existing NASA project aimed at low Earth orbit (LEO) to terrestrial communication.
Feasibility: Adoption of our method will require some changes to communication infrastructure; however, the ability to communicate in the presence of in-band interference could change the paradigm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication standards.
Key Use Cases: Any case involving line-of-sight communication links that cannot take advantage of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, which rely on multipath propagation.
Possible Partnerships: Florida International University, University of Akron, Xadite Perceptions, Department of Defense (DoD)

“Wicked-Wild” Idea:
Exploit the orthogonality of vortex beams to allow for simultaneous usage of specific portions of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
Isolate data channels using spatial-domain filtering techniques as opposed totraditional frequency-filtering techniques.
Increase data transfer volume by using multiple vortex beams of the same carrier frequency.
","thank you so advanced air mobility or ATM is the future of air transportation that explores the development of new technologies to revolutionize airspace usage and is a rapidly developing field that will include low altitude passenger transport, cargo delivery and public service capabilities. However, because the radio spectrum is a limited resource to increase of aircraft in the air, space raises concerns about potential interference with aviation communication.
This increased disruption of critical communication and navigation signals can be caused by a variety of factors, both internal and external, to aviation systems.
In severe cases, radiofrequency or RF interference caused by unintentional emissions or deliberate jamming can lead to important safety risks.
Here is how vortex beam communication stands as a promising solution to interference mitigation in the context of AM are are at vortex harnesses, an underutilized property of radio waves.
Their orbital angular momentum or OEM, the angular momentum of an of an electromagnetic or yam wave is composed of two parts, spin angular momentum corresponding to depolarization of the emwave and orbital angular momentum OAM associated to the spatial distribution of the EM wave. This integer value defines the number of helical terms the wavefront makes around the propagation axis.
By tailoring the antenna ray to generate a desired oil mode, say plus one, we can transmit a targeted beam.
Only receiver is equipped to detect the plus one mode will be able to decode the information.
Now visualized data traveling on an invisible highway for each lane is defined by distinct helical twist in the signal itself.
This twist, characterized by the OEM, forms the foundation for a powerful technique known as spatial multiplexing, which allows for the transmission of multiple independent data streams on the same frequency.
By utilizing the spatial domain, we overcome interference limitations inherent to current RF systems.
The orthogonality of OAM modes unlocks a dramatic increase in data capacity for applications previously limited by bandwidth constraints.
But beyond share capacity Re Vortex offers unique addressing capabilities.
Each OEM mode has a specific topological charge acting as its unique identifier or fingerprint.
Imagine beams with charges, for example plus one and -2.

In crowded environments with many RF signals.
OEM filtering allows receivers to focus on their specific OEM fingerprint, ignoring irrelevant signals and thus reducing interference while enabling targeted information delivery with high signal to noise ratio and accuracy.
Overall, encoding data on OEM modes consists of an information signal modulating the electric field of the RF wave.
By carefully manipulating the phase distribution across the wavefront, thus creating specific OEM modes carrying the encoded data, the then multiple OEM modes carrying different data streams can be superimposed and transmitted together.
Specialized antenna arrays at the receiving end can then separate these modes based on their unique face patterns, all of which makes this vortex beam communication technology hold the key to reshaping the way the data is transferred and interference mitigated in a soon to be crowded airspace.",,,,
How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,Wicked Wild,High,High,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation. 
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: Develop HT-PEM technology for aviation
Using HT-PEM fuel cells to power electric aircraft eliminates CO2 emissions while sustaining timely, long-distance travel capability. 
Develop HT-PEM fuel cell materials specifically for aviation 
Focus on membranes, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA)
Include other stack components as opportunities allow
Test HT-PEM fuel cell materials, single cells, and cell stacks under aviation load profiles (high-power flight condition for take off and climb, low ambient air temperature and very dry air at high elevation, etc.)
Demonstrate HT-PEM FC energy efficiency and CO2 emission reductions","the pitch is high temperature PEM Fuel cell for aviation.
Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.
It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.
it is the importance into the air and contributing to global warming, the high energy efficiency of fuel may offset the lower energy density of hydrogen.
Therefore comparable few compare size of fuel tank can be used for similar flying distance of country airplane. You're placing.
Engine with a highly efficient fuel cell is a great option.
It means the size of fuel tank and the frying range of current airplane and also completely eliminated the imaging their causes, global warming and protect air. The Department of Energy is developing high temperature paint fusia for ground transportation, especially for heavy duty vehicle.
The pitch this piece is for developing the similar technology for aviation.
The developments are where you focus on material specific for aviation application, such as membranes, electrodes, membrane electrode assembly and other stack components to measure the progress of this activity.
High temperature pain, fuel cell stacks and system will be tested under the aviation load profile. The result will be used to modify and optimize fuel cell system for aviation application.

"Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST)
",Wicked Wild Sprint,High,High,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science/engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.
What if…we could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by
 improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety, and efficiency using lightweight polymer aerogels
Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage
Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy
","So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten.
It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks.
So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport.
This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.

Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95% large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly.
You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft.",,,,

Optical Fiber for electric-vehicle temperature sensing
Completely Optical – Won’t cause or affected by EMI
High Spatial Density – multiple sensors cascaded onto one fiber for FEM level temperature gradient monitoring","Today I want to propose the idea of using optical fiber for temperature sensing for electric 5 vehicles. Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle.
Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e.
Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation.
Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen.
You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical.
It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal.
Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery.
You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire.
Now you have you you have a temperature distribution every half inch interval across your your airplane.",,,,

"Assuming that the commercial trend towards hospital consolidation and specialization continues and patients are farther away from advanced treatments, how might aviation impact accessibility of healthcare? (See: medical staffing, changes in healthcare business models, Direct-to-consumer health apps, travel nurses, etc.)",Discovery,Medium,High,"Sources:

https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2021/11/2022-Environmental-Scan.pdf. 
Problem Scoping: 
Two divergent Healthcare Scenarios: 
Medical treatments become cost-effective enough to move to or stay in local hospitals, lessening the need for travel. 
Medical treatments become less cost-effective (or some do) to the point that treatment centers consolidate and are farther away from patients on average. This is the more likely scenario given the trends in health-apps, investing, travel nurses, minute-clinics, hospital funding problems. 
Given scenario (2), there are two Aviation Scenarios: 
Personal Air mobility or commercial aviation drops in cost sufficiently to counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Medical treatment (tools/supplies) become small enough and cheap enough to ship TO the patient, possibly by air (air hospital?) and counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Sub Problems: 
Does the shift to outpatient clinics reduce the availability of hospitals offering complex procedures and put greater need on air travel for the critically ill? 
Population is more distributed (remote work), so will more people be farther away from centralized services that cannot be financially solvent in closer facilities? 
Will the advancement or cost-efficiency of treatments drop enough to distribute healthcare to local clinics? 
Why is this a problem? 
As medical health care technology becomes more advanced, the cost of health care more expensive, and population more widely distributed, aviation may have an increasing effect on the accessibility of health care. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Aviation can provide services in the future that are presently either centralized or provided by a range of other transportation. The challenge will be to right-size and optimize the aviation capability to the needs of the health care problem. 
Transportation of medicine via UAVs with appropriate temperature/atmosphere/humidity control which can provide timely delivery, 
Airborne ambulances that can transport while providing care. 
Transportation of medical equipment to remote areas (on a rotation? As part of a pre-planned schedule?). 
Miniaturization of health tech 
More temp-stable medical goods that can survive rougher transport. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation ranging from the advent of personalized air vehicles to package delivery UAVs allowing a series of options for both human and package delivery; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. These trends are counterbalanced by ever increasing healthcare costs that may limit patient access. 
Telehealth – making people more comfortable with remote healthcare 
Robotic Telehealth – letting doctors stay where they are but keep robots local for surgery, etc. 
Cheaper diagnostics - reducing the need for travel to find out if you have a problem, reserving travel to treatment.’ 
Medical Tourism – will the cost and accessibility of medical tourism counterbalance the need for rural access. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
This is ANOTHER way that discrepancies between rural vs urban healthcare is mitigated by aviation. We scoped this to 100M because we believe that smaller procedures will become more accessible/local, but not ALL procedures. So globally, we believe that 100M people will be impacted or make decisions about treatment and safety based on access and cost. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? 
Score: 4-5 Majority 4 (given the costs and advanced nature of the treatments), but small percentage will be 5s, where care is absolutely critical to immediate survival. 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
We are assuming that the geographic consolidation of healthcare continues to the point that access is reduced. If that trend continues, we are confident aviation will be a greater player in access. If not, the question is moot. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy?

Perform proof-of-concept testing for multifunctional bio-inspired structures that can transfer heat and absorb sound for aerospace applications,Wicked Wild,,High,"CAS Asked:   How might CAS-funded research support multimodal transportation on Earth and beyond? 
Problem:  Too many newly patented concepts are languishing in the wicked ‘valley of death,’ as humanity strives to mitigate and adapt to climate change and explore the universe in peace.  Space stations orbiting the moon, lunar bases, missions to Mars, safer, cleaner, and quieter vehicles for land, sea, and air will all require new multifunctional structures to absorb sound and transfer heat.  Promising concepts are needed to survive the journey from lab to factory, as the teams working on them change and grow. 
Opportunity:  NASA has an opportunity to support the growing team of people interested in maturing Broadband Acoustic Absorbers, US Patent 10,460,714. NASA has claimed that the bio-inspired broadband acoustic absorber can be used as multifunctional structures that can absorb sounds over a wide frequency range, especially at frequencies below 1000 Hz, while also transferring heat, offering improved performance over state-of-the-art.  The first prototype of this structure was designed and 3-D-printed at NASA GRC.  This accomplishment was shared with the global public in an invited article in the recent special issue of the International Journal of Aeroacoustics on acoustic liners for aircraft engines. This project is gaining visibility among our peers and competitors by the efforts of research, engineering, tech transfer, educational outreach, and public relations teams.  Additional proof-of-concept data is needed to explore this claim, helping government and industry evaluate its potential.  
Implementation Strategy:  CAS funding will help the ‘multifunctional bioliner’ team design and build prototypes to be

Archive the SBIR/STTR Final Reports Submitted to NASA in the NASA STI Repository
CAS Asked:  What hard problems should NASA Aeronautics leaders be aware of? 
Problem:  Transferring government funded research to industry is important, and to support entrepreneurship, NASA participates in the United States’ Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Programs. According to the United States’ Small Business Association’s (SBA) overview, the United States federal government disbursed $3.28 billion to seed new business to the SBIR program and $453 million through the STTR program in 2019.  Of that total, NASA’s portion for funding both the SBIR and STTR programs in 2019 was $183 million, as reported by the SBA.  Each organization receiving SBIR/STTR funds must submit a final report to NASA.  Unfortunately, these final reports are not easily accessible for study by the NASA technical workforce since they are currently not included in the NASA STI Repository.
 
Opportunity: SBIR/STTR Technical Monitors could submit final reports to the NASA STI Repository via the STRIVES process.   A new category of NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) for SBIR/STTR Final Reports could be created.  Since these reports would include company proprietary information, distribution would be limited to “NASA and NASA-contractors only” and electronic copies of the reports would be searchable on NTRSregistered.nasa.gov.
Implementation Strategy:  NASA CAS team could initiate an effort to work with the NASA STI Team, STRIVES team, and SBIR/STTR teams to make the changes to our final report processing and the STRIVES/NTRSregistered.nasa.gov databases to make this information more accessible to the NASA technical workforce.

Ambient Temperature Gaseous Hydrogen Fueled Aircraft,Wicked Wild,,High,"Desirability:  The world is beginning to embrace hydrogen as a fuel source of the future. The U.S. DoE has significant efforts ongoing to learn how to incorporate hydrogen into the U.S.’s energy base. Aerospace has long desired to have hydrogen fueled aircraft, due to its energetic nature. Now the assumed unending supply of Green Hydrogen makes the concept ever more entising.   

But past aircraft designs for utilizing Hydrogen relied on having and controlling hydrogen in liquid form at temperatures near absolute zero.  If we rely instead on pressure to contain the needed volume, in hydrogen gas form, there will be no need for fragile cryogenic insulation systems. Aircraft will operate normally with regard to stand-by time without having to address fuel boil-off and the associated required replenishment. 
Structurally the tank walls will be strong enough to accommodate fuselage bending loads and will be simply integral with the rest of the fuselage structure. 

With this wicked technology development NASA can define hydrogen storage systems that not only define the design of reliable hydrogen aircraft, but provide a proven technology for our future energy storage systems in general.

Universal Transponder,Wicked Wild,,High,"Describe the problem NASA should be solving.  The description can also include notional desirability, key use cases, possible partnerships.Recently, a co-founder of Zipline remarked that it’s easier and safer to conduct Beyond Visual Line Of Sight (BVLOS) flights in foreign countries with a shorter history of aviation because they can mandate that all aircraft are equipped with transponders.  Detect And Avoid (DAA) is very straightforward when every aircraft is broadcasting its position.
Resistance to equipping U.S. aircraft with ADS-B has been significant, with concerns around costs and...freedom?
ADS-B, the result of years of effort that incorporated input from all aviation stakeholders, incorporates neither encryption nor authentication, so it can be easily spoofed by anyone with internet access and a $250 radio.
Can NASA design a transponder that is inexpensive enough for the government to provide free, for every aircraft?  Could that transponder incorporate features that satisfy the privacy concerns of reluctant aircraft pilots while still providing adequate DAA performance?  How would data be collected and managed?  Would it make sense on cars?
We’ve been waiting for new, magical technologies to solve DAA for more than a decade.  They don’t seem to be around the corner.  We need clever approaches to socio-technically engineer a solution, using existing technologies to construct solutions that meet important societal and technical needs...releasing these brakes on U.S. innovation.
""Wicked-Wild"" Ideas:#1: Aircraft would drop flammable, fireworks-based breadcrumbs as they flew, lighting a fuse on each one, that had been cut to a random length.  The resulting chains of explosions will warn others that an aircraft is near without indicating whose airplane it is.

Uncoupled landing gear,Wicked Wild,,High,"What if we could take the landing gear off airliners?  Benefits of doing so are on next slide.  The idea is a ground truck/cart that takes the place of on-board gear.  The truck is more like a big driverless platform which matches the aircraft approach underneath and ‘captures’ the aircraft from below as it mirrors the plane’s landing.
Benefits
Less flight weight = less fuel burn
Little to no taxi fuel burn
Less takeoff fuel burn
Smoother landings
Extra space
Longer tire life
Less flight weight = less fuel burn
2 - 5% of MTOW is landing gear.  Eliminate part of this and fuel burn decreases accordingly
Little to no taxi fuel burn
Aircraft APU used during taxi for A/C and power.  Engine start just prior to runway.  
Less takeoff fuel burn
The ground truck with a large rechargeable battery will supply a major part of the thrust on the takeoff run.
Smoother landings
Use of a ground truck for landing allows for upgraded suspension as no weight penalty exists on the ground truck.  
Extra space
More room where the landing gear was could be used for anything or nothing.  Extra fuel if that was desired.  Or extra cargo space.  Or simply for nothing making the MTOW less.
Longer tire life
Tires on the landing truck do not hit the ground stationary.  Thus, no cross-tread splits and wear.
More on the concept
The landing truck would have:
A tracking system to pinpoint its position under the aircraft
An electric drive system to match the aircraft speed
A crosswind steering system to match landing yaw
An upgraded suspension system for a soft landing
A capture system for stability
A communication system with the aircraft
More on the concept cont.
The vision for the landing truck is something like a Tesla car but with a ‘structural framework’ instead of the ‘body.’  It would be larger than a car, and have aircraft tires.  More like a big high-tech electric go-kart made of I-beams and large tires.  It would be autonomous but would talk to the aircraft for critical functions.  It would be a quadricycle (or more) offering increased stability over the traditional aircraft tricycle arrangement.  It would also have advanced suspension vs what is currently on aircraft.
Summary
The technology exists for a structural ground truck to mirror an incoming aircraft from below.  Engineering implementation remains and would be a wicked challenge.  Capture system will be groundbreaking.  People issue of acceptance will be a challenge.  It is a truly wicked problem in every sense.  But……”doable” if the will exists.  And it makes sense keeping the heavy ‘less-power-dense-than-jetfuel’ battery on the ground but still contribute an overall flight profile reduction in fuel burn.

"Catalyze transformative change through high impact research and outreach 
with under-served communities via the Cleveland FEB Tutoring Program and the Future City Competition",Wicked Wild,,High,"CAS Asked:   What roadblocks are stopping us from transforming our lives, environment, and society? How might CAS-funded aviation research bridge the rural-urban divide and increased connectivity for underserved communities? How might CAS develop the future workforce considering the social impact and perception of aviation?

Problem:  We live and work in a world and a city with significant inequality.  Diversity is one of our few defenses against ‘group-think.’  To reach our ambitious aerospace goals, to discover peace while we explore the universe, and to live more sustainably on earth while mitigating and adapting to climate change will require extreme innovation and inclusion.  Diverse teams are creative teams.  Women and people of color are still under-represented in engineering and their ideas and skills are vitally needed.
 
Opportunity: Meet tomorrow’s innovators today!  CAS teams who want to ‘pursue problems on the edge of uncomfortable’ and who also are also able to work well with students are invited to perform educational outreach with the Cleveland Federal Executive Board Tutoring Program and serve as a volunteer Engineer Mentors for middle school students participating in the DiscoverE Foundation’s Future City Competition in addition to performing their exciting CAS-funded research at NASA.

Implementation Strategy:  The Future City Competition theme changes annually, and it is possible for 40,000+ students, educators, engineering, and STEM professionals to imagine a city of the future that includes an air transportation system accessible to a growing population that is cleaner, safer, and quieter than the one we have today.  Currently, there are no schools in the Cleveland Municipal School District that have participated in this STEM competition, even though NASA engineers have been working as tutors at Clark School in CMSD since 2007.  The AIAA Aeroacoustics Technical Committee recently voted to approve changes to the Aeroacoustics Technical Award criteria, to recognize the combination of high impact research and outreach more holistically, and efforts like this are encouraged.
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:  Members of the NASA GRC CAS Project Team can lead transformative change in our lives, environment, and society and develop the future workforce by working with NASA’s Office of Education, NASA’s Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity, Cleveland Federal Executive Board, the Cleveland Municipal School District, the DiscoverE Foundation, and the professional engineering societies to participate more fully in the Cleveland Federal Executive Tutoring Program and the Future City Competition.",,,,,
CARES: Connecting Aviation with REligionS,Wicked Wild,,High,"NASA Outreach to and Dialogue with Religious Leaders and Religious Peoples: Accessing a NASA-Underserved Population?Religions in the United States and across the world reach many NASA-underserved communities.
Conducting outreach to religious leaders and their followers may provide a new approach for NASA to access and learn from ‘new’ communities.
Engaging religious leaders and peoples in NASA missions will educate and inform both NASA and the religious peoples.
Notional Desirability: High – Motivating more people to engage with NASA and the NASA mission will create greater awareness in each. The world looks to NASA to step into leadership roles. NASA is perceived to have credibility, trust, and respect worldwide. Is NASA perceived the same way within the world’s religious communities? Is NASA already reaching this community or not?
Feasibility: Highly questionable, aspirational, extremely challenging, and extraordinarily controversial. Religious leaders may be willing, available, guarded, suspicious, or unavailable. Caution is needed when approaching this opportunity to not inflame prospective religious leaders or religions. Ethical, moral, legal aspects, and policy must be evaluated. 
 
Viability:  Indefinite. If support and participation by religious leaders and religious peoples can be usefully and peacefully demonstrated, viability may be very long duration. 

Potential use cases: Create opportunities that incentivize religious communities to use UAVs in partnership with NASA to engage their communities in topics that affect their daily lives such as climate change, geoengineering, and health and wellness. For example:

	• Religious people incorporate routine ritual behavior in their everyday life – this is normal.
	• NASA can learn from religious leaders and religious peoples how to incorporate NASA ‘mission specific rituals’ in people’s lives as it 	   relates to behaviors needed to confront climate change.
Possible Partnerships: Various religious organizations, religious leaders, followers/congregations. Can be tested on small scales in USA initially and extended worldwide through existing international NASA partnerships.Wicked-Wild"" Idea:",,,,,

Software Defined Aviation
Opportunity:Describe the problem NASA should be solving.  The description can also include notional desirability, key use cases, possible partnerships.NASA Aeronautics’ mission to reduce the risks and advance the capabilities of aviation predates NASA itself. 
Aviation’s new and future capabilities, along with its new and future risks, are undergoing a large-scale shift from the world of hardware to the world of software.  Continued success for aviation depends on our ability to architect a future where we manage and protect the software supply chain of aviation as well as its hardware supply chain.  The “software bill of materials” for a new aircraft design will need to be managed just as carefully as the hardware bill of materials was in the past.  Aviation will not escape the transformation and disruption that software and cloud services have brought to every other facet of modern life.How will the aviation industry develop, test, and deploy millions of lines of code into certified, safety-critical, networked systems?  How will they detect security and safety vulnerabilities as they emerge, so they can rapidly develop, test, and deploy security and safety patches for those systems? How will they manage dependencies and interactions with other software and software services that are being independently developed, improved, operated, and patched, while aircraft that rely on them are in the air?
Large-scale cloud service providers, DOD, medical device manufacturers and standards 
bodies are blazing a path to enable the next generation of safety-critical systems.
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:Try to keep aviation separate from the biggest trends and technologies driving innovation this century.  Ignore aviation’s biggest challenges until they are forced upon us, then desperately try to retool our skills and workforce to remain relevant.

Thermoplastic Efficient Recyclable Revolutionary Aircraft (TERRA) Project,Wicked Wild,,High,"Future aviation must move away from conventional hydrocarbon fuel to reduce the effect of aircraft emissions on Earth
Liquid hydrogen (LH2), a frequently discussed fuel alternative, requires cryogenic pressurized tanks with larger volumes than conventional hydrocarbon fuel tanks due to low energy density of LH2. This tank requirement makes LH2 unfavorable for fueling tube-and-wing aircraft.
A hybrid-wing-body (HWB) aircraft is a highly efficient configuration concept conducive to accommodating both payload and the large pressurized tanks required for LH2 propulsion in the proximity of vehicle’s center of gravity while simultaneously offering aerodynamic advantages 
Development of technologies enabling HWB aircraft configurations will lead to:
LH2-fueled aircraft that can be designed to support a broad range of markets (by operating range, payload, and other performance metrics)
Immediately reducing fuel consumption for hydrocarbon-fueled aircraft and supporting LH2-fueled aircraft as the market emerges

High Pressure Gaseous Hydrogen Tanks Enabling Green Aircraft,Wicked Wild,,High,"Opportunity:	Efficient hydrogen storage is a key enabling technology for the advancement of sustainable aviation applications including hydrogen-powered conventional aviation concepts as well as the design of revolutionary  environmentally friendly vehicles. The most often considered tank-based hydrogen storage is either as compressed gas or as cryogenic liquid. Hydrogen has a gravimetric energy density that is 2.8 times higher than traditional jet fuel. However, even in a liquid state, hydrogen has a 4.1 times lower volumetric density than jet fuel. Taken together, this requires larger tanks that must be maintained at cryogenic temperatures, even though hydrogen packs 2.8 more energy than jet fuel. 
	Compared to liquid hydrogen, gaseous hydrogen needs to be compressed and, for conventional tanks, the operating pressure is typically not higher than 700 bar. Even at this high-pressure and room-temperature, the gas density is 1.8 times less than liquid hydrogen, which means less hydrogen for a given tank size. Even larger tanks would be needed to pack the same amount of hydrogen as liquid hydrogen tanks. 
	If liquid hydrogen would be allowed to boiloff from -252.8° C and 1 bar 
to room temperature in a closed tank, the pressure in the tank would reach 
2,000 bar, at which point the density of the gaseous hydrogen would reach that 
of liquid hydrogen for the same tank size.""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:2,000 bar is a huge load (700 bar is state of art) and would require a large structural

High Altitude Research Platform,Wicked Wild,,High,"Opportunity:
Since its establishment more than 30 years ago, the NASA Balloon Program at the Wallops Flight Facility has provided high-altitude balloon platforms for scientific and technological investigations that have contributed to our understanding of the Earth, the Solar System, and the universe.  The balloons are launched from New Zealand and the Antarctic, with truss-work gondolas supporting the payloads.  Descending under a cargo parachute at the end of mission, many of these gondolas and payloads are severely damaged or land in areas where they cannot be retrieved at all.
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:
An opportunity exists to replace these gondolas with an unmanned aerial system.
This would eliminate the complex retrieval procedures in place today and
permit re-use of the payload carrying platform resulting in a cost savings for
NASA high-altitude balloon missions.  A UAS could be configured as a payload
carrier.  At end of mission, the UAS would descend to its operational altitude
under parachute.  Once its flight propulsion system is activated, it would separate
from the parachute and be brought to a landing close to its launch point to
facilitate recovery and re-use of both the UAS and the payload.

Square Tanks for Cool Vehicles - Reusable LH2 Aircraft,Wicked Wild,,High,"Desirability:  The U.S. has wanted to take advantage of the power in liquid hydrogen as a fuel for commercial aircraft and space access vehicles since the 1950’s. Project Suntan was abandoned in the ‘50’s, the Space Shuttle settled on throw-away tanks in the ‘70’s, routine space access via the reusable X-33 was abandoned in the ‘90’s due to cryotank failure.  Numerous commercial aircraft concept studies, including NASA’s up to today, show great value if the technology can be tamed.  Handling LH2 and its efficient vehicle packaging was and still is a prime stumbling block in our attempts to tame this cool technology. 
Global demand for zero carbon transportation modes via LH2 is here. It’s Green and it’s being implemented for the ground and marine transportation sectors. Air transportation and Space Access as well will need to be able to take advantage of this abundant clean future fuel source.

Opportunity:
In-situ, or single-step, consolidation is a disruptive technology that has the potential to eliminate the

Hydrogen aircraft offer ‘free’ cryogenically cooling.  Blended wing body aircraft are enabled by fully superconducting (SC) machines and are the preferred configuration for long range LH2 planes.

The Wicked Scenario
A wandering stellar black-hole (~10 solar masses) passing near the inner solar system would be a catastrophic event for the inner planets and all life on Earth. 
For the human species to survive it would need to escape the solar system and reach another star with a habitable planet. 
2
The Wild Solution
Survival strategies may involve building generational starships and space ""Arks"" that would be sent into the galaxy carrying all human knowledge, specimens of earth-life, including human life in the form of gametes and DNA. 
These Space Arks would have Artificial General Intelligence onboard to periodically scan for potential habitable planetary systems and to fully awaken when such a planet is reached perhaps after many millennia. The on-board AGI will then begin the process of evaluating the planets around a star and develop a plan for human habitation and transportation using in situ resources as much as possible. Then the AGI will incubate the first generation of humans and train them into adulthood to help prepare them for living in a new environment. 
NASA's ultimate mission may be to develop the technologies needed to assure the survival and safety of the human species in such worst-case scenarios. Enabling the spreading-out of human life in the galaxy may perhaps be the most important role these technologies may play.

The AI technology for this kind of mission must:
be able to learn, reason and solve problems at least as well as a very intelligent human being able to study and evaluate new environments and fabricate the robots and crafts to explore and prepare them for human occupation.
have virtually complete range of essential human expertise including all medical knowledge and the technology to incubate a generation of human beings starting by IVF.
sufficiently understand human development and psychology from infancy to adulthood to help prepare them for inhabiting a new environment
maintain the ultimate objective of ensuring the preservation and increase of human life in the universe while respecting the self determination of new human communities

The Wicked Problem
What is AGI and how does it differ from current Machine Learning?
In a simple sense AGI is a computational intelligence (AI) that can emulate human reasoning and problem-solving abilities. It can learn, reason, communicate and solve problems in a similar way to humans, and could even supersede human intelligence through self-improvement.
Contemporary machine learning methods utilize sub-symbolic approaches and focus on pattern recognition, classification, function approximation for very specific problems and narrow applications. Usually require massive amounts of data. 
Neuro-symbolic machine intelligence integrates neural networks with symbolic and statistical reasoning methods into a more general framework for implementing more general computational reasoning approaches.
See links on last slide for more in-depth presentations and discussions on the characteristics of AGI

The Wicked Problem
Developing Artificial General Intelligence is the Wicked Problem being posed here
The AGI research community is relatively small but not all that new
Researchers are pursuing various approaches to developing AGI from bottom-up neocortex brain structure modeling to emulation of cognitive functions.
High technical risk, high payoff. If developed to a sufficient level, could help solve other wicked problems and used in many other ways to benefit humanity.

Applications on aircraft is a good target platform for AI use cases that can learn how to operate in complex unstructured environments with respect to the safety of humans on and off-board.
ARMD platforms will allow faster turn-around on challenging real-world experiments
Technologies developed as a result will have beneficial application to air transportation, industry and the economy, and ultimately extensible to human and robotic space/planetary exploration

How does this fit into ARMD?
Continued ...
Potential beneficial collaboration with the NASA Formal Methods research community 
Increase relevance of ARMD within broader NASA mission. ARMD develops intelligent robots that fly, and transport and interact with people.
Development of applications such as AI pilot/ co-pilot that can learn, reason and communicate with humans about the aircraft, its systems, its software, the human operator, the passengers, the environment, the mission, and how to operate autonomously and safely
Development of AI digital twins of pilots and engineers and their skill sets and cognitive abilities. An AI digital twin learns/models the knowledge, habits, skills and psychology of a person to be able to understand and cooperate with that human operator

Why should NASA be involved?
Other agencies involved in AI R&D like DoD and DARPA are more focused on defense and military goals, scenarios and applications
Likely to remain classified and unavailable to NASA for a while and the development path may not ultimately be aligned with NASA goals
Unlikely to be developed from a positive human-centric starting point (to always be helpful to humans as individuals and communities)
Unlikely to have the same objectives and context in solving problems
""Big Tech"" companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, FaceBook, Apple will likely develop AI for commercial purposes that are highly centralized, focused on short term business goals, and will likely keep critical core technologies and data proprietary
NASA development would provide public oversight and insight that would enable public trust for such a capable technology
To ensure that AGI has the ultimate goal of preserving and extending human life over indefinite periods of time
9
Why should NASA be involved?
Continued ...
Extending and preservation of human life and knowledge under worst case scenarios may be NASA's ultimate mission. 
NASA should seize on this early moment in AGI R&D and get in on the ground level to influence, steer and support AI development in the direction of humanity's best interests (many of which will likely differ from the immediate goals of private industry, military, intel and defense)
NASA missions will require a development philosophy that require many diverse human skill-sets into a unified AGI (from teaching children, to caring for elderly people, to being any kind of medical doctor, counselor or engineer)
NASA might be the most appropriate government agency to do AGI R&D

Tropospheric Observations with Reusable Radiosondes (TORR),Wicked Wild,,High,"Describe the problem NASA should be solving.  The description can also include notional desirability, viability, feasibility, key use cases, possible partnerships.""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:
Traditional radiosondes hanging from weather balloons provide data streams that are a critical inputs to a diverse array of analyses, models, and planning activities with enormous societal impacts.  The limitations of traditional radiosondes are widely known and well understood within the research community, but radical ideas for innovation are constrained by the need for consistency with historical measurements and compatibility with existing national and international standards, workflows, analyses, methods, and human habits that have a proven track record for quality and consistency.  Addressing these barriers to create a “step-change” in the frequency, availability, and portability of high-quality radiosonde measurements would have immediate and significant impacts on our abilities to better model and understand climate and weather.  Our abilities to predict, understand, manage, and plan for catastrophic events such as wildfires and hurricanes would also be significantly impacted.  Frequent real-time atmospheric profiles would also be very valuable to busy airports and vertiports.
Create a “drop-in” replacement capability for weather balloons that provides data of sufficient quality to meet international standards, in the formats and styles preferred by existing users, and architecting the solution so that it can be easily implemented by others, so they can get cheap, high-quality data using sustainable methods that satisfy regulatory and safety standards at all times.

We need to build a team or we can’t get this done.
NASA is perfectly placed to bring its technical skills, experience, deep domain knowledge, and resources to demonstrate Feasibility and Viability:
The seeds of our Dream Team are already in place and energized to work these problems.
Technical skills needed are in-house:
UAS operations

Atmospheric Science (all aspects)
Prong 1 leverages NASA’s strengths to demonstrate Feasibility and Viability
Highly constrained choice of sensors

This capability would have a huge impact on prescribed fire planning and resource allocation during operations
Amazon Basin
Currently only able to fly radiosondes ~four months a year due to budget constraints
Satellite measurements are limited spatially and temporally with cloud cover issues as well
Reusability and lower cost could solve these problems
Pre-hurricane Soundings
Expanding locations and tempo of atmospheric soundings in the boundary layer could have large impacts on near-term (6-8hr) forecasts
Acoustics Research
Acoustics research regularly requires collecting an atmospheric profile as demonstrated in the September 2022 collaborative Learjet flight test involving GRC, LaRC Acoustics branch, and LaRC UASOO
Measuring the atmospheric state is critical to understanding how sound will propagate
High Impact Opportunities:

Impact is Key
Enable effortless adoption of products by stakeholders
Ensure data quality is as good or better than existing methods and verifiably meets WMO standards
Provide data in standard forms for 100% compatibility with existing tools and processes

Fight Wildfire with AI and Drone Technologies,Wicked Wild,,High,"During 2021 and 2022, wildfire caused $11.2 Billion in damage across United States.  The state of California spent $2.4 Billion during the same period mitigating state’s wildfire.  The methods of fighting wildfires have not changed significantly for past 50 years.  Recently, there have been some R&D efforts both from industries and academics on utilizing drone technologies to aid wildfire fighting.  However, most of such efforts are very indirect in nature (such as taking photographs of fire or measuring temperature of the fire) and do not effectively aiding the actual fighting of the wildfire.
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:
Other technologies such as AI need to be combined with drone technology in odder to make an impact on fighting wildfire.   Drones equipped with AI needs to be autonomous; patrolling the high-risk area, detecting the fire, conducting initial assessments, gathering area information (temp, humidity, wind direction & magnitude), and communicating the information to aerial firefighting stations.  
Here are a quick possible scenario.
While patrolling, Drone A (stationed at Bodfish Self-Charging Drone Station) 
near Isabella Lake spotted a fire near a campsite ? Drone A collects data (temp, 
wind, etc.) using its onboard sensors ? Drone A informs the Aerial Firefighting
Station at Bakersfield ? Quick response from the aerial firefighting aircraft put
out the fire.

Opportunity:The Arctic and the Antarctic are melting. The weather is growing progressively extreme. The point of no return is arguable, but the time to clean the air is now. 
Direct carbon removal at ground facilities is in development. NASA is working on making aircraft emissions cleaner. This is essential and valuable, but it’s not clear whether new, electrified aircraft will be in time or in sufficient numbers to make a difference in the global warming trends.
NASA can add to the clean-up effort via large-scale airborne operations for direct air cleanup. ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:
Use sun-powered and wind-powered airships: 
Cover outer surface with lichens to consume CO2 and produce O2. Lichens thrive in extreme temperatures and altitudes. Investigate other biomass solutions for carbon removal via photosynthesis on the surface of airships. 
“Inhale” CO2  and extract carbon over areas of high concentration. Move operations where needed in response to changing atmospheric conditions. Investigate miniaturization of carbon extraction technology so it can be accommodated on airships.
Investigate other greenhouse gas removal.",,,,,
Improved Flight Quality for Urban Air Mobility Vehicles,Wicked Wild,,High,"Current flight vehicles have an obligation for safe and comfortable cabin experiences.  The aircraft developed for the urban air mobility market will need these conditions as well. Even now, there is a need for small aircraft to quickly transport supplies (food, medical, etc.), and people (taxi service, medevac). NASA can join the discussion and become a technological leader in this area by helping to create an aircraft structure that addresses many existing flight concerns concurrently. 

Problems that need solving:
Isolate vibrations from the cargo area for a more stable ride
Noise reduction for areas within the flight paths
Vertical and horizontal travel paths needed in urban settings

These problems can be addressed with multifunctional structural solutions, 
with an emphasis on weight-neutral or weight-saving designs, such as tilting
rotors and optimized propellor ducts.  

""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:A conformed structural battery pack could be integrated into air vehicle structures, allowing the
battery to also be used simultaneously in multiple systems (e.g., load carrying, anti-icing,
vibrational damping, energy absorption, etc.) to maximize system efficiency.

" NASA AERONAUTICS WITH YOU WHEN YOU FLY, On other Planets! 
Increasing collaboration between the “First A” and “S” in NASA to explore the Solar System",Wicked Wild,,High,"Opportunity: The success of the Ingenuity helicopter has shown the powered, controlled flight on another planet is possible and has opened the door for more advanced vehicles to fly on Mars as well as other planets. Dragonfly, which will arrive on Titan in 2034, is a rotorcraft which will replace both a  lander and a rover. Lighter and heavier than aircraft both separately and in combination are being considered for future missions to Venus. Extreme environments, increasingly complex missions and greater reliance on autonomy will provide many new and difficult challenges to extraterrestrial aircraft designers.

Describe the problem NASA ARMD should be solving: Other than atmosphere and environment, designing aircraft for other planets is similar to designing aircraft for Earth. Low weight and drag, efficient propulsion, autonomous and reliable operation, good vehicle stability and control are common challenges for both applications.  How do we take advantage of  NASA ARMD experience, expertise, lessons learned, design tools, test facilities and other capabilities to meet the challenges of developing aircraft to fly on other worlds? Some specific collaboration examples include:

Aircraft focused Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) tools for optimal vehicle design
Computational Fluid Dynamics and Wind tunnel testing for airfoil, rotor and wing design and simulation model generation
Energy storage and electric propulsion expertise including high efficiency motors, fault detection and system health management
Aircraft structure design and analysis tools.  Structural testing facilities
Stability and control design and analysis tools. Aircraft autonomy expertise, research, software and hardware.
Flight Simulations and simulation framework for overall vehicle analysis and hardware-in-the loop testing.
Terrestrial flight testing for model validation and overall systems testing
Wicked-Wild Idea?: Increased collaboration should never be considered Wicked or Wild but may face many
challenges such as lack of awareness and communication, stove piping, lack of inclusion, separated workforce and ther factors.  One key is identifying other factors. One solution is to find commonality in the challenges as opposed to focusing on the differences

Evaluating Joined-Wing Configuration Advantages,Wicked Wild,,High,"My proposal to the CAS is to study Joined-Wing Structures for their aerodynamic and structural advantages and unconventional options for control surface harmony.
The Joined-Wing arrangement consists of two sets of wings, like a bi-plane, but with significant stagger and sweep such that the arrangement of wings appears like a diamond from above.
I have been studying Joined-Wing Structures for over ten years and have used it as a subject in various undergraduate and graduate studies, including the basis of my graduate thesis.

DVF
Desirability
Show me on airline that wouldn’t jump at the opportunity to provide the same passenger-seat-mile deliverable for reduced costs! Joined-Wing configurations have a potential to provide aircraft designs that are more fuel efficient.
Viability
Like any aircraft design and development project, engineers would prefer to have full-scale flight demonstrators, often preceded by scaled demonstrators or wind tunnel models.
A previously developed test-rig concept would allow testing the various configurations in a wind tunnel or scaled demonstrator to collect data.
A wind tunnel model or scaled demonstrator would not present any new technological hurdles.
Feasibility
There is no leap in technology required for evaluating joined-wing structures. Instead, an effort made to test the concepts, collect the data and evaluate the data.

Thank you!

Structural Advantages: Stronger and lighter?
Aerodynamic Advantages: Less induced drag?
Wing Geometry Configurations:
Stagger: Positive Stagger and Negative Stagger
Sweep: Evaluate the effects of stability and efficiency of various combinations of wing sweep.
Dihedral: Vary the dihedrals of the wings to evaluate effects on stability.
Incidence: Vary the effects of different incidences on the wings.
Aspect Ratio: Vary the effects of different Aspect Ratios between the two wings.
Tail Configurations: What is the relationship of the wing geometry with regards to the need for tail surfaces? Tailless = Less drag = greater efficiency.
Unconventional Control Arrangement and Harmony:
Which wings have control surfaces? Both?
Can a form of Direct Lift Control (DLC) be achieved with flap-like surfaces on both wings?
Can such a control surface configuration provide the advantages of flaps, without the changes in pitch, therefore reducing trim changes and facilitating better forward vision for the pilot.
Better Center of Gravity (CG) control options (if fuel can be stored in both wings) for irregular or abnormal loading configurations, reducing trim drag and thereby increasing efficiency.

Real-time Performance Based Certification,Wicked Wild,,High,"Opportunity:Describe the problem NASA should be solving.  The description can also include notional desirability, key use cases, possible partnerships.Can NASA take a more literal interpretation of “Performance-based Certification” and architect a system in which a novel, freshly-assembled system would be able to self-assess and demonstrate whether it was airworthy, document it sufficiently well that regulators would be able to certify it for flight, or better yet, approve the aircraft’s self-certification?  The continued certification status of the system would be based on continuing observations of its performance, as it is used, damaged, or repaired.  
A failed self-assessment would describe where it fell short, if there is a configuration issue or identify a series of flight demonstrations that would need to be flown successfully to be certified.  Self-assessments would include regulatory compliance, failure mitigations, as well as specific details of the operational environment, mission design, and payload.

3-D Volumetric Flight Deck Display,Wicked Wild,,High,"Opportunity:Commercial flight decks have a tactical display (commonly known as a Primary Flight Display [PFD]) and a strategic display (known as a Navigational Display [ND]).  Flight crews use these 2-dimensional displays to create a mental model of where the aircraft is in relation to terrain, obstacles,  and other traffic.  It is also critical for the flight crew to know the relationship between the aircraft, their intended flight path, and the terrain.   Aircraft displays have evolved from “needles and dials” to electronic “glass” cockpits.  Perhaps the next evolution to flight deck display technology is the display of aircraft state information in a 3-D format that could be intuitively interpreted by flight crews.  These volumetric displays could also be leveraged by Air Traffic Control (ATC) to quickly visualize traffic.

The current Safe2Ditch technology can assess available flight controls and direct a crash in smarter areas within reach.  This proposal aims to conduct studies of the effectiveness of supplemental power sources to expand the range and options of the directed crash. This will involve comparing the effectiveness of electrical, pressure, and chemical propulsion coupled with the Safe2Ditch technology to see if the capability to crash safely can be expanded with acceptable additional weight and complexity.
The FAA, drone manufacturers, pilots, businesses using drones, and the general public would benefit from increased safe ditching options.  This may accelerate the granting of Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations by increasing options to crash safely. Available small scale power sources and controls may not meet the requirements and system development may need to be done.  Drones carrying additional energy in the form of rocket motors, pressure vessels, and extra batteries could increase the severity of incidents they are designed to mitigate.  Payload reduction may alter the business case for drone deliveries and reduce profits in trade for safety. 
The problem will become more evident as UAVs become more commonly used for deliveries and other duties.

Fly-by-no-wire     ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Traditional electrical wiring or fiber requires 100’s to 1000’s of connectors, contacts, wires/cables. Each connector/contact/cable requires engineering, fabrication, installation, troubleshooting, inspection, maintenance, and tracking over the life of the project or vehicle. The associated costs are increased weight, reduced space, and increased time and money spent. This culminates in vehicles being on the ground longer along with budges stretched and schedules consumed. For commercial aviation, costs are generally passed on to the consumer making flight a more expensive endeavor. For government aviation, the cost is paid by the tax payer. Technical solutions include replacing wire with wireless options such as radio and optical light (nIR, visual, UV) communication techniques. Radio and visual light techniques have pros and cons, but can compliment each other, making for robust and secure communication. A true fly-by-no-wire capability is near and opens up new regimes in system development and integration including rapid turn-around times for some Maintenance. A fly-by-no-wire solution still needs to be thought-out, proven, and standardized.
NASA, DoD, Commercial Aviation, Rocket Companies. Any vehicles: space, air, land, sea. Security and EMI concerns related to radio wireless. Can a no-wire solution be sufficiently robust for all safety critical wire replacement applications? Can institutions gain enough confidence in wireless solutions to use them? Latencies in wireless systems can strain time-critical uses especially for latencies introduced by radio; optical may be able to cover time critical situations – what are latencies like when operationally transitioning from one wavelength regime to another? Are there real-world situations that would render full spectrum (radio-to-UV) wireless solutions inoperable? Does wireless really decrease complexity or increase it? Do wireless solutions reduce overall failure modes or introduce more? Is there really a market for drop-in no-wire systems? Will power wiring still be needed thus eliminating a no-wire solution, or will power systems be ready through robust batteries, energy harvesting, and nuclear batteries? Are wireless solutions still worth pursuing even with power cabling?
Need for increased aerial efficiencies is already here. Cabling has been causing problems for decades – there are NASA and industry working groups dedicated to working through cable challenges. At the same time wireless technologies are booming and new components and techniques are hitting the market fast. The time to transitions is now.
The problems associated with wires and cabling has been around for decades. With new solutions entering the market that allow access to optical light wavelengths for high-speed robust communication, the time to act is now.

Constructive Aerial Contact: Capturing/Merging,Wicked Wild,,High,"The current paradigm is to place large distance between aerial vehicles to keep them from destructively interfering. This makes sense for vehicles that are not meant to interact, but we have become stuck thinking this is how it should be for all vehicles. We have precluded ourselves from imagining a large realm of potential applications involving extreme proximity flying, capture, and air-air landing/docking. There is a hole in the aviation portfolio created from a lack of attention on constructive aerial contact and its enabling technologies. This unexplored space of constructive aerial contact could be as large as the non-interacting domain. Example applications of constructive aerial contact: Mothership-drone capture/release (to carry out efficient science studies, DoD needs, package delivery); in-air emergency services; Stratospheric Station payload deliveries (such as telescopes) and general maintenance; long-endurance airship restocking/emergency services/general maintenance/passenger disembarking/staff changeout; space-to-earth sample/goods capture (eliminates parachutes); space elevator atmospheric capture. a) Current stigma of maintaining large safety distances.  b) Fear of deconstructive contact (includes unintended collision) during tests flights.  c) Fear of handing over a large window of safety critical operations to a fully autonomous system.  d) Possibly unable to obtain sufficient real-time insights into autonomous processes (may include AI vision and neural nets).  e) Possibly no time for humans to react to rapid out-of-control situations when making contact.  f) Few proper aircraft available for extreme proximity and contact research (attritable aircraft or aircraft with right airflow characteristics and engine locations to allow for safe research).  g) Current COTS products not geared to extreme proximity flight or capture.  h) Tracking relative distance between two bodies from far away to extreme proximity requires passing through multiple “focal” planes. Single-solution COTS products are limited or non-existent.  i) Robust extreme proximity detection is non-trivial.  j) Combination of synchronization + extreme proximity flight + constructive contact in a dynamic aerial environment is extremely difficult.  k) Fast reactive + precision control systems for aerial vehicles needed for extreme proximity + synchronized flight will be challenging with today’s established tech.

Securing our Information-Dependent Future   ,Wicked Wild,,High,"We are ever more dependent on a constant flow of information to our phones, to our computers, to our cars. But the communication technologies transmitting this information are threatened by hackers, human error, and natural disasters from earthquakes to wildfires to solar storms. How can we best secure the availability and authenticity of the information we need, and what emerging technologies and traditional, but perhaps currently overlooked technologies, are best utilized and how? 
Almost everyone, from people who have lost their phone or had GPS direct them to the wrong place or experienced a power outage! Securing communication is not easy and can have overhead that people are reluctant to adopt. Solutions can also introduce other dependencies, so tradeoffs and likelihood must be weighed. 
The problem is already significant and increasing. 
That can be as hard to predict as predicting the next earthquake, major solar storm, or major communications hack. But most of the world will experience one or more of these within the next decades.
Technological advances that enable us to gather more information, analyze it,  and communicated it. Greater autonomy and interdependence!
Algorithmic and computational. Societal. 
Aviation is ever more dependent on information from local weather to on-board sensors to air traffic information. This dependence will grow substantially as the airspace becomes more complex, with more vehicles and types of vehicles, and more autonomy.
NASA has substantial knowledge related to aeronautics communication and information reliance, including knowledge about the likely future. It also has experts in many technologies, from emerging computing technologies to more traditional ones that can help address the problems. Potential partners include other federal agencies, industry, and academia.
The problem goes beyond inconvenience, to serious safety and security implications. It can significantly affect uptake of new technologies, and should affect their design in the first place.
It is a hard problem, requiring coordination among different, often competing, parties. Furthermore, it is often looked at as a negative, uninspiring problem. People often would prefer to be looking at what new capabilities we can have rather than thinking about unpleasant events and how to mitigate them. But the solutions can be exciting and innovative.

 Partial Discharge Mitigation   ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Aircraft have traditionally used 28 volts for power distribution, but newer aircraft are beginning to use 270 volts. The first all-electric aircraft are using voltages of up to about 500; however, designers who are looking at megawatt-class electrified-propulsion systems for single-aisle airliners are talking about kilovolts—up to 3,000 volts. But such high voltages in the reduced air pressure at the cruising altitudes of commercial aircraft can lead to a potentially hazardous phenomenon known as partial discharge. So new cabling designs and insulation systems will have to be developed to avoid hazards such as partial and corona discharge. This project aims to create very low SWaP, micro scale magnetic field sensor to measure these minute magnetic fields created by the moving charges in aircraft cabling using non-metal defects in Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices. These sensors would not only be able to detect current accurately, but also determine current vector and deliver spatial current density measurements. This would allow for accurate hot-spot detection in conductors well before cable breach is created. This problem is wicked because without a low-SWaP robust capability for in situ measurement of megawatt cabling health, certification of near-term electrified aircraft would be extremely difficult.
Electrified propulsion branch and electrified aircraft manufacturers. The proof of concept is there, however, miniturazation of apparatus is necessary. A clear path has been put forth on how to decrease SWaP, however, there is always technical challenges during process.

Demonstration of minute magnetic field measurement via defects in SiC will be completed. (Months 15-18) 5. Miniaturization of setup (Months 12-24)) This work should be evaluated based on whether the system has the capability to measure minute changes in magnetic fields, needed sensitivities are determined to measure precursors of partial discharge and current density in conductors, and device theoretical sensitivity has been determined to be able to meet these requirements when full device is realized.
Demonstration of technique in year 2 and Initial miniaturization in year 3. Year 3 we can start implementing testing on aircraft hardware.

FTE lite will monitor all the data and alert the FTE of a mission critical parameter out of range and everyone when a safety of test parameter is out of range.

Laser and Microwave Sonic Boom Reduction ,Wicked Wild,,High,"The current method of designing a low boom supersonic aircraft, leverages passive techniques for sonic boom mitigation including shaping; long nose and highly swept wings for example. And strategic placement of the engine inlet in order to minimize the sonic boom heard on the ground. Although this type of design philosophy shows positive results with regards to sonic boom mitigation, it places restrictions on the shape and carrying capacity of the aircraft. Also, aircraft based on this design philosophy have poor handling qualities, especially at low speeds. The application of plasma dynamics to sonic boom reduction has the potential to loosen some of the design restrictions encountered with shape optimization. This introduces the possibility of having shorter, wider and larger commercial supersonic airplanes with a larger carrying capacity and improved handling qualities. Shorter supersonic aircraft i.e. without a long nose would have dimensions closer to commercial subsonic aircraft and theoretically would require little to no retrofitting at airports.   NASA should be investing in investing in a concerted effort towards finding a way to design low boom aircraft that leverages on energy deposition as a means of sonic boom mitigation.

Accelerated eVTOL Design-to-Flight Testbed (eD2F),Wicked Wild,,High,"There are currently 980+ electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft concepts listed on eVTOL News (https://www.evtol.news/aircraft), which each have very different configuration attributes. Design categories include tilt-rotor, tilt-wing, multicopter, and lift+cruise vehicles that each have advantages and disadvantages for different Advanced Air Mobility missions. Because of the complexity and lack of data for eVTOL designs, the conventional process for aircraft realization is ill-suited for design, prototyping, modeling, control, and flight testing of eVTOL vehicles. Typically, vehicle designs are a single vehicle concept and are treated with extreme care in every subsystem. Damage or failure is not an option when it comes to vehicle operations. The team proposes to build a modular aircraft to compare the characteristics of a variety of different eVTOL configurations (e.g., differences in propulsor control versus blown wing control versus traditional airplane control) to explore a multitude of vehicle concepts while demonstrating an approach to rapidly develop safe, robust, well-performing flight control algorithms. The team would develop a process that reduces aircraft development timelines substantially and streamline it so that only a handful of people are needed to guide a subscale vehicle from design to flight in less than one year. Rapid prototyping techniques will be employed to quickly and inexpensively produce testbed aircraft allowing the aircraft to be rapidly flight tested. Irreparable aircraft damage, although not a desirable outcome, is accepted as a possible outcome to enable rapid testing and flight control law validation; this paradigm will help identify key barriers for multiple eVTOL configurations, which are typically high-coupled, over-actuated, and highly non-linear systems posing significant challenges for traditional controls methodologies.

Solar Powered UAS Sea eVTOL,Wicked Wild,,High,"NASA should be working on the problems that industry/academia cannot or isn't - high risk high reward activities that push the bounds of aviation and mixes a variety of different disciplines. New technologies of eVTOL and UAS make a lot of the science communities (internal and external to NASA) processes outdated for data collection. Having a UAS that can have minimal amounts of human action by being solar replace weather balloons and radiosondes should be investigated. Ideally it would be able to suffer through storms and waves and sit atop the water for long periods of time until remotely commanded to fly and take data and picked up weeks or months later after data required is completed.
NOAA, national weather services, etc. Recent look into the portfolio of NOAA shows lots of active involvement with UAS but nothing that revolutionizes the data collection process other than using multicopter platforms.Remotely piloted aircraft are still in discussions with the FAA. Designing a water tight UAS eVTOL that can withstand surviving in an ocean for several weeks. Potentially a dual vehicle that can also ""drive"" on the water as well. 
This would be a new capability that organizations/ storm chases could actively adapt into their repertoire reducing the risk to people on the ground while major weather events are starting to form or are already active. Additionally, a vehicle like this would grow the capabilities for an increased amount of data collection to inform better decisions, which could lead to new ways of data collection or new scientific discovers based on an increased capability. Each individual technology apart of this vehicle has been emerging for a few years, but never integrated together in this unique style.
With stronger storms and weather related incidents, finding better ways to detect patterns and intensities is critical. 
Excessive training for UAS operators, rougher and more frequent storms need to be alleviated 
Unique manufacturing methods, custom autopilots, and regulator guidance.
The problem provides an aeronautical solution in a new way to a traditional method of operating for the science and climate industry.
NASA has quite an extensive history of building, designing and operating new types of airplanes in support of research activities. NASA Langley has expertise in designs for eVTOLs, while NASA Glenn has additional history of working on electrical and motor UAS. There are additional groups currently operating UAS with NOAA that have showed interest in unique vehicles to assist in their data collection all across the country. It would also be good to work with industry that have built floatable airplanes to understand the buoyancy and water tight sealing parts of the project.
Theoretically, if a vehicle can be built that would survive in the water, it could also operate during storms on the land, which is currently a limitation of most UAS.

Automated Microstructure Processing Lab (AMPLIFIES) ,Wicked Wild,,High,"What if you could automate experimental processes to be performed orders of magnitude faster, with subsequent analysis and performance optimization achieved through machine learning and artificial intelligence? To solve a variety of wicked problems, transformative innovation will require generation and analysis of wicked datasets in wicked short timelines. In contrast, traditional approaches require years of research, hundreds of experiments, and intensive analysis to take an idea from conceptualization to flight qualification. The innovative integration of machine learning and experimental methods is especially important for increasingly complex functional systems including batteries, fuel cells, coatings and sensors. For these studies, the rapid production of samples with sufficient variation necessary to widely survey processing-structure-property landscapes and the associated analysis of experimental results is especially challenging due to the inherent complexity. The Automated Microstructure Processing Laboratory and Intelligence Framework for Innovating Energy Storage (AMPLIFIES) aims to accelerate improvement of energy storage performance and enable scale up of advanced microstructures to deliver optimization for electrified aviation powertrains.
Commercial Aviation manufacturers seeking electrification, FAA for qualification and validation of safety envelopes, Grid Scale Utilities seeking energy storage for renewables and load leveling, Automotive EV manufacturers for increased EV range, NASA ARMD STMD, DoD, Commercial Battery Manufacturers.Initial investment is a barrier due to the experimental equipment and workflow development required. A risk is that the lessons learned and recommendations from generation of wicked datasets for optimized energy storage and conversion devices may require additional interfacing for integration at the industrial scale. Existing processes may not be able to leverage advanced solutions.
Investing in new capabilities to improve research efficiency today immediately propels research outcomes from already committed resources beyond initial goals. Further, future scientific discoveries may be achieved at a faster rate and with greater flexibility to changing trends and demands.
Next generation tools and frameworks will be required to deliver agile solutions that meet the always changing demands and mission outcomes far beyond what are envisioned today.
The artificial intelligence and machine learning revolution is an ongoing paradigm shift impacting every aspect of research and development across scales from materials to systems. Additive manufacturing methods are actively changing the way materials, components, and devices are produced.
Advanced automated additive manufacturing tools with tunable composition and micron scale spatial resolution will be required. Additionally, the software and programming necessary to automate sample processing, analysis, training of machine learning models, and feedback to process control will be necessary.
Electrified aviation requires novel devices with significantly advanced performance metrics, e.g. specific energy, attained through multiscale optimization of advanced composite microstructures and compositions.
GRC LMN has expertise in processing and development of energy storage materials. GRC LMS has expertise in integrated computational materials engineering (software and data science development). MSFC ES33 has expertise in additive manufacturing of aerospace qualified devices. GRC has high performance computational resources. GRC LEX has expertise in energy storage systems design and integration.
Improved research frameworks would provide significant impacts on the rate and scope of materials development across applications areas including structural materials, environmental barrier coatings, integrated sensors, and beyond. Improved energy storage would have profound effects on multiple sectors, including transportation, grid energy storage for renewables, reduction of emissions, leading to lower cost of energy and a greener future.

Active Alleviation of Ice  ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Use of oscillating field whose energy is slightly higher than the hydrogen bond energy and frequency is in a range from kHz to GHz for dipole coupling that does not allow the bond between water molecules. Thin-film based dielectric barrier charge (DBC)*, that is attachable to any surface and generates oscillating fields with recovery circuit, actively prevents any surface from ice formation with very low power.
Applications of the active alleviation of ice formation are envisioned for any objects, such as airplanes, advanced air mobilities, automobiles, wind turbine blades, roof-tops of buildings, cryopumps, and cryogenic processes.No risks and barriers, but requires a revised system power bus of aircrafts.
New capability is added but requires about 3 years to implement (TRL 6~7)
Icing over aircrafts is the seasonal impact and requires a technology for weatherization of aircrafts.
Development of ice-phobic materials is current trends but has limited benefits. Proposed Active Alleviation of Ice Formation over Aircraft Surface is new and simple and inexpensive approach requiring a short developmental period.
Thin-film fabrication of dielectric barrier charge (DBC) circuit but industries already have this capability.
Directly related between the problem and aviation.  However, the benefits are (1) Alleviation of ice formation over the aircraft surface, and (2) Thin-film DBC covers and makes surface smooth and eventually reduces micro-turbulence sources like riveted spots. 
Aircraft manufacturers, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Gruman etc.
Water molecules do not form an ice layer due to never allowing crystallization under dipole coupling with the oscillating field of dielectric barrier charge (DBC).

Energy Harvesting for Wireless Sensors  ,Wicked Wild,,High,"The process of wiring sensors on the aircraft or spacecraft is time-consuming and costly. While wireless sensors can mitigate some of these issues by reducing complexity and weight, they introduce new challenges related to power supply. These sensors either require batteries, which add additional weight and need periodic recharging, or an alternative power source. Furthermore, batteries are not well-suited for the extreme temperatures encountered in aerospace environments. This concept proposes harvesting the untapped energy sources surrounding the aircraft or spacecraft—such as heat, vibration, and electromagnetic waves—and converting them into electrical energy to sustainably power wireless sensors.

Second-order effect: The reliance on energy harvesting could lead to overconfidence in the system's reliability. In scenarios where the harvested energy is insufficient due to environmental changes (less sunlight, reduced vibrations, etc.), critical data might be lost. Third-order effect: The potential loss of critical data or system failures could necessitate the implementation of emergency response measures or the development of backup systems, increasing complexity and potentially reintroducing costs that the energy harvesting module was meant to mitigate.

The Product Triangle and its AppStack  ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Aeronautics is going through an incredible period of rapid growth in many areas. Often the greatest hindrance to the rapid deployment of new concepts is the time it takes to proceed from concept formation to commercial deployment through the rigorous sequential systems engineering processes.  Methods to speed up the systems engineering process are key.
The stakeholders are at least three key core competencies/expertise at NASA: 1) research/development flight algorithms, 2) testing/formal methods/robust software engineering and 3) certification expertise. What ties these three groups together are that they define the stakeholders for the sequential steps of the systems engineering process for a given flight algorithm. The prior prototype development of the AppStack was in a Latex document which supported index to figure, equation and software code line number indexing. Future development of the AppStack as a standalone, machine interpretable object will require decisions as to 1) the representation format, e.g XML, SysML, Matlab, JSON, 2) how engineers will author the AppStack, 3) how formal method tools will ingest the AppStack.
The problems exists as measured in the long lead times to mature technology from a TRL 1 proof of concept algorithm to the a TRL 6 flight operational certified system. Leads times are often measured in 3 to 5 year time periods.
Problems come to ahead, earlier when completely traceability from code to tests cannot be accomplished, when guarantees of systematic test coverage cannot be guaranteed and when even after certification and testing of the algorithms, real world operational off-nominal conditions (e.g B737 Max) are encountered.
 The trends are the rapid advancement of approaches to any and all of the subsystems of modern aircraft with the vision of ubiquitous VTOL/UAS  in the NAS as a 2045 vision.  In addition advancements in AI technologies such as ChatGPT (which can be trained for specific corpus), may provide novel tools to ensure better designs.
1) An assessment of the tools used by the flight algorithm three teams of the product triangle needs to be defined.  2) The tools need to define import/export utilities to support the AppStack. 3) The shared annotation of the AppStack needs to occur for each of the three groups: 3a) The algorithm developer needs to carefully define the trace between the three layers as well as identify the assumptions in each layer including the bounds of nominal/off nominal operation; 3b) Next the testing engineers need to scope the test to include not only the traditional MC/DC testing, but also software formal methods such as static analysis, modularized decomposition, model checking and other still be developed techniques; 3c) Finally the certification engineers need to extract from the AppStack the necessary trace information required to meet the certification basis of the regulatory agency (e.g. NASA, DOD, FAA, other).
The time it takes to mature an aviation product from TRL 1 to TRL 6 can take on the order of three to five years. It is proposed that sing the combined concurrent product triangle and the AppStack shared physics/math/code data structure, drastic decrease in time and increase insight will occur.
Yes, NASA already has the resources, in this case the three different teams of technical expertise already exist following their own agenda. What is being marshalled, is a closer collaboration and product analysis data flow between the three groups. 
The second and third order effects of the synchronized efforts between the three groups is a convergence of tools which not only meet the needs of the three groups, but innovations in tools are driven by quantitative requirements of each of the groups. For example, the development of testing approaches which can systematically test all of the physics and math assumptions in the code will drive the develop of new tools (cite RTCA, SAE, CFR, other).
The nature of the gap is the fact many flight algorithms designed by the state of the art research leave IMPLCIT the physics and math assumptions in the code (the assumptions at best exist as comments in the source code, but not in the executable). Once the algorithm designers move on that knowledge is lost, once the code is compiled that knowledge is lost as well. Methods such as the AppStack aim to address the loss of flight algorithm design knowledge.",,,,,
SAPIENS: Keeping expertise alive ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Sound engineering design, arguably, like no other endeavor, requires not just formal education but hands-on work and apprenticeship with experienced “master” engineers. Between the 1940’s and 1960’s, aeronautical engineering went through a tremendous spurt of active aircraft design, resulting in several generations of exceptional aeronautical designers. With cohorts of experienced designers retiring and new engineers having few opportunities for practical experience or “masters” for apprenticeship, industry has suffered an acute decline of expertise in design capabilities and fundamental decision making. This fact has been confirmed repeatedly in conversations with engineers and management in aircraft and automotive industry. In a light but representative example, a world-famous expert and instructor in aeronautical design (Daniel Raymer) related the following: on request by an aircraft manufacturer to observe the design process for a vehicle, he discovered that the engineer in charge was not aware that the tires on a landing gear expand with use and planned for the wheel well to accommodate the new wheel size exactly.  The problem of declining expertise is not limited to aircraft design and is exacerbated by the following factors: •	Traditional designs have reached an equilibrium in many aspects (aircraft as a cylinder with wings). Progressing beyond traditional designs requires a new degree of expertise and inventiveness.  •	The most important step in design, arguably, is the placement of bounds on the system under consideration. Major design mistakes occur when the system under design is too narrow, i.e., when real system complexity is underestimated. Examples abound, from unconsidered effects in human-machine interactions in aircraft design leading to tragic outcomes (e.g., Air France 447) to large-scale catastrophic ecological disasters (Western economists’ attempts to “improve” agriculture in Bali).   With unprecedented global interconnectivity in all aspects of human existence, as well as growing reliance on AI in automated decision-making, aeronautical and other design areas will face enormous, usually unappreciated complexities.   •	As the world grows more complex, paradoxically, education in essential disciplines is declining. In particular, fundamental mathematical reasoning and tools are being taught less, depriving the upcoming designers of the irreplaceable critical faculties and skills.  •	In a related seeming paradox, it has been repeatedly demonstrated thar reliance on AI for decision-making fundamentally weakens the human ability to reason independently. The “use it or lose it” maxim applies. This is a particularly pernicious outcome of over-reliance on AI, because humans quickly lose the capacity for situational awareness and practical evaluation of the outcomes of AI functions.   This is a truly wicked problem: AI gives us information, offers solutions; yet our inevitable overreliance on AI makes us gradually lose the ability to reason and even evaluate what AI does for us.   Proposed solution space: Develop a multimodal AI Design Assistant that would assist a human designer throughout all stages of design, from requirement elicitation to formulating the design problem in required complexity to formulating representations amenable to solution and analysis of system-wide consequences, without negative impact on human cognitive capabilities.  NASA has tremendous expertise and data in complex systems design. We should work on developing AI tools that help create new designs that work in our world of ever growing, unprecedented complexity, rather than undermine our awareness and ability to function competently. Such tools would be of use not just to NASA or just in aeronautical engineering, but to all educational institutions and all areas that involve decision-making. 
The entire DOD, as well as aircraft manufacturers, are well aware of this problem. In a specific example, a Boeing colleague revealed in a recent conversation that the declining expertise is so pronounced that Boeing is attempting to collect all possible previous design examples to teach them to the new engineers. However, parsing through thousands of examples to extract appropriate information is turning out to be very difficult. It is simply not clear on what to focus and what information to choose. The main barrier would be the availability of data. For instance, it is not clear that aircraft manufacturers would be eager to share their data that involve not just successes but failures, which is essential for developing appropriate design assistants. However, this risk/barrier can be mitigated as follows. NASA does have its own data, which can be use for the development of the basic tools. Once the fundamental methodology and tools are in place, external organizations can use them to train using their own data.
The problem is acute right now and may blow up unpredictably, especially with proposed designs for climate change. 
The problem can come to a head at any instant. For example, given the critical climate developments, it will be increasingly easy to attempt large-scale engineering solutions, such as geoengineering, with potentially disastrous unintended consequences. We have many examples of ecological disasters due to attempts to manage systems without full understanding of system boundaries and effects (e.g., the Bali example). Large-scale geoengineering attempts can potentially have disastrous and irreversible consequences. Some attempts have been made already (Mexico), albeit on a small scale. The need to reverse the loss of expertise and sound decision-making is critical.
Please see the answer to Question 2. 
Large language models (underlying technology, not just the question-and-answer aspect), multidisciplinary and multiobjective analysis and design optimization, mathematical modeling, systems analysis, human-machine interaction, cognitive science, software engineering. 
Aeronautic engineering is in major need of a prompt solution to declining expertise (please see Items 2 and 3) and would be an immediate beneficiary of a solution.
NASA has appropriate expertise in all capabilities outlined in Item 10. The main expertise resides at LaRC, ARC, and GRC. 
The effects of the loss of expertise in engineering design range from the obvious, such as aircraft crashes, to globe-wide effects, such as potential geoengineering solutions without a sound understanding of the consequences, and to various social consequences.",,,,,
Bioliner for the ANCF: A Feasibility Study ,Wicked Wild,,High,"Past attempts by NASA to 3D print other acoustic liners for the Advanced Noise Control Fan have not been feasible.
NASA, NASA bioliner licensees, aviation noise reduction community. We will determine if recent advances in design and additive manufacturing help us overcome past problems for feasibly printing a large acoustic liner effective over a wide frequency range especially below 1000 Hz.
The feasibility study could be performed within 6 months from a small civil servant team.
Deliverables include a liner design, a cost/time estimate for an entire 3D printed liner, and a sample print for one section of the annular liner.
Improved acoustic liners that are thin, lightweight, and effective over a wide frequency range, especially below 1000 Hz are needed to achieve safer, cleaner, and quieter aircraft.
This will demonstrate the use of a new design code for acoustic liners and the feasibility to print large liners for the 48"" diameter ANCF.
Improved acoustic liners are needed for most aircraft.
Yes, recently NASA has developed a computer code to design annular bio-inspired acoustic liners.  New printers are available at NASA GRC.  There is a NASA post-doctoral engineer working with the ANCF that would be instrumental in testing the liner if we prove that 3d printing the entire annular liner is feasible.
A feasibility test would determine if we could produce a bioliner for the ANCF, which would provide proof-of-concept data at the desired frequency range.  The design code and results of the feasibility study would be documented and provided to licensees who are trying to commercialize this new liner technology.",,,,,
Riders on the Calm before the Storm (ROCS)  ,Wicked Wild,,High,"What if NASA Aeronautics could enable astonishing improvements in our ability to predict the intensity and tracks of tropical storms? Atlantic hurricanes are produced by dynamic processes that start on the other side of the ocean, in air masses that leave the continent of Africa. Important details of these processes are invisible to space-based remote sensing instruments. In-situ measurements are the only way we can understand and follow the processes that may or may not produce a tropical cyclone.  There is a strong need for continuous in-situ surveillance of these air masses as they traverse the Atlantic to follow their development and predict where, when, and how they will impact us.
NASA is deeply involved in efforts to address this problem and is a valued partner of NOAA, the EPA, and the academic institutions and commercial companies that are focused on this area.   Solutions must meet strict science requirements while also being practical in terms of cost, operational complexity, and environmental sustainability.  Solutions will need to integrate seamlessly into existing data capture and analysis workflows and be compatible with international laws and regulations regarding use of the skies and sea.  
This problem is an annual, recurring issue that impacted 792 million people in 2019, according to a Rand Corporation study.  Every hurricane season brings risk, along with opportunities to advance our understanding and improve our responses.  
Continuously. Officially, hurricane season runs from June through November, with storms at their most intense and numerous from August into October.  Due to climate change, the severity of these storms and their impacts will continue to increase substantially. 
In 2005, I was part of a small team tasked with determining whether HALE (High Altitude Long Endurance) aircraft of that time were a potential solution to this problem.  They were not.  There have been substantial advances in many relevant technologies since that time.  In 2022, the Zephyr 8 solar-powered, high altitude aircraft stayed aloft for 64 days, at an altitude of 60,000 feet, traversing 35,000 miles. From 2011 to 2021, Google’s Loon project developed and matured a wide range of technologies that made managing an actively controlled fleet of high altitude balloons a reality.  Today, there are thousands of autonomous drones operating routinely in the world’s oceans, supporting all kinds of science.  These include SailDrones that range in size from 14-72 feet and displace up to 14 tons. SpaceX has also demonstrated to utility of autonomous ocean barges to support flight operations at sea. 
Solutions in this space will take the form of aerial platforms that can carry and support the scientific instruments required to make the needed in-situ atmospheric measurements. They must meet requirements for both spatial and temporal measurement intervals to establish effectively continuous surveillance of the evolution of these air masses.  Taking these measurements for weeks at a time, over the open ocean, may require launching or recovering the aerial platforms from seagoing vessels.  Autonomous systems and autonomous operations may be critical to clearing cost and sustainability barriers.  New commercial aerial platforms coming to market may open new paths to meeting these needs, but if they fall short there are opportunities for creative ideas that leverage other new technologies to close gaps and enable new step-changes in capability.
These in-situ measurements must be made from platforms flying in the air they need to measure.
Yes.  To be successful, this work will need guidance and participation of: the NASA atmospheric scientists already doing this work in coordination with its many stakeholders; the NASA researchers, engineers and pilots who plan and execute our flight campaigns through these air masses; the NASA teams and individuals who have already partnered and worked with potential external partners such as Zephyr, QinetiQ, Aurora Flight Sciences, AeroVironment, Saildrone, etc.; NASA researchers who could provide performance analyses to support exploratory trade studies.
The downstream effects of managing the impacts of tropical storms better are extensive.  More accurate estimates allow for more targeted evacuation orders reducing inconvenience and costs for people who would have been given evacuation orders currently.  This increases public trust in forecasts and safety warnings over the long term.
If we are able to identify one or more solutions to this specific problem that include high levels of autonomy while being very sustainable, the use cases could expand to address weather modeling and prediction problems in other regions, for a broader range of applications and beneficiaries (e.g., agriculture, wild fire, flooding, emergency response, etc.)

"How might medical ethics (Bodily Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice) conflict with aviation/transportation autonomy, distributed monitoring and services?",Discovery,Medium,Low,"Rewording Option: 
Something like: How will medical ethics need to change/adapt/evolve (if needed) in order for (medical related?) services such as autonomous aerial transport, distributed monitoring (over area, inside vehicle) to be accepted and deployed? 
Will current medical ethics (if remain unchanged) help or hinder the development/adoption of medical related aviation services such as autonomous transport (of goods or patients), and healthcare delivery and monitoring? 
Sub Problems: 
How does autonomy impact healthcare? How does autonomy of an aviation-based transport conflict with medical ethics? 
How will medical ethics interface with advancements in aviation (PAM, AAM, distributed monitoring/services, autonomous drones, etc?) 
Why is this a problem? 
This is a subset of a broader set of problems associated with the introduction of new technology and it’s impact on patient health. This scenario is different from conventional usage of air transportation that traditionally involves significant human in the loop interactions. Rather, to the extent that autonomous and automated systems become an aspect of health care, a new set of medical ethics concerns arise. Patient monitoring is necessary during medical transport. If this involves an autonomous or automated transportation system, then That patient information resides with in that autonomous or automated system and it needs to be handled appropriately. Timely delivery of supplies and services by whatever means is a core foundation of health care. If an autonomous or automated system fails in its designated function, that failure just impacts individual health care and an understanding of responsibility or liability is needed_. Broadly speaking, issues involved are: 
Privacy 
Local regulations, laws 
Decision making 
Medical transport 
Liability 
Maximizing patient care 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
There are two aspects of this problem. The first is technical regarding the capability of an autonomous or automated system the carry out its function in an optimized fashion minimizing impact to patient health. The second is the framework of legal and societal restrictions that impose upon the autonomous or automated system a layer of functionality that, for example, ensures confidentiality of patient information or appropriate response in emergency condition. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
One trend is that health care on a local level is becoming increasingly more distributed and advanced. The complexity of health care provided by, for example, emergency air evacuation services has increased over the years. The overall trend is that more can be done locally rather than in a centralized hospital setting. A second trend is changes in the air transportation system is envisioned over time to allow new forms of both personal air transport_ as well as also delivery of supply and materials. A third trend is the advancement of artificial intelligence and data handling systems that may be able to not only allow new types of vehicle operations, but also an ability to handle information in a more complex and situationally appropriate manner. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?. 
The overall impact varies depending on the type of transport. Related to emergency transport and care, the population may be limited and more concentrated in rural areas. However other forms of medical transport are much more common. For example, professional transport a patient from one health care facility to another is a relatively common occurrence within parameters dictated by legal and health insurance regulations. Further, if air transportation and medical supplies using, for example, autonomous or automated drones becomes a common occurrence, then the impact on the overall health care system on the performance of these technologies can be significant and broad based. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? (high, medium, low) 
Score: High (depending on the application) 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
Score: _Medium 
This assessment depends upon the development and implementation of technologies still in their formation stage and have not established a economic foothold in the market. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-ARMD/NASA aligned? 
The technical aspects of this problem are within NASA’s domain and are specific application in the healthcare field of evolving air transportation autonomous and automated systems. The legal and societal aspects of this transformation that might be addressed by technological advances, but in general are more dependent on economic factors in the health care system beyond NASA’s purview.

What is the problem or need?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances generate an environment of ubiquitous monitoring both on a personal and societal level. 
Personal health monitoring: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level. Privacy concerns arise related to use of personal information
Wearables hacking - how can we trust the data and protect the users?
There are also remote medical sensing technologies that could be as ubiquitous as CCTV, and even drone-mounted.
NASA's Aeronautics technologies can enable persistent, wide-area coverage of climate-related parameters and NASA's Earth observing satellites add to the data gathering.
Such sensing capabilities enable new opportunities to provide actionable information, detect problems and improve life, while at the same time imply severe ethical issues if misused.

What trends are driving this capability or need that may influence the problem or solution space?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances that allow ubiquitous monitoring, combined with Big Data processing and communications, means that the infrastructure structure for Ubiquitous Sensing both on a personal and societal level already exists.
Economic drivers are moving towards use of monitoring technologies to drive specific outcomes, not necessarily for the benefit of the population.
Privacy concerns are declining among younger generations: decline in need for privacy with respect to certain areas of life may allow wearables to be used to communicate more broadly as part of IoT using cloud
TinyML may enable wearables to be powerful computers, recommendation engines
Broad sensing system capabilities are both becoming more pervasive and more easily implemented enabling a new level of monitoring and surveillance.

<Scenario>
(gpt-4) 
In the not-so-distant future, we find a world grappling with the consequences of climate change, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), and the increasing capabilities of surveillance technology. These global challenges and opportunities touch everyone, yet they disproportionately impact communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which often bear the brunt of climate change effects and are least equipped to adapt to or influence AI and surveillance technologies.

Imagine a coastal community in one such LMIC. The rising sea levels, a direct consequence of climate change, threaten their homes and livelihoods. However, their voices are often unheard in international climate policy discussions. Their limited resources and access to technology make it hard for them to adapt to these changes or participate in mitigation efforts.

Meanwhile, the world around them is becoming increasingly digital. AI systems are transforming economies, Surveillance technologies are becoming ubiquitous, and wearable devices that could help detect and warn of disasters are out of their reach due to economic constraints. These communities are at risk of being left behind or, worse, exploited as the world around them transforms.

This scenario is not just a possibility but a reality for many communities around the world today. The ethical impact of these changes is significant and global, affecting billions of people. The aviation industry is uniquely positioned to influence these challenges, from contributing to climate change mitigation to leveraging AI for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.

However, there are significant gaps in understanding and addressing these problems. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of AI and surveillance technologies are equitably distributed and do not infringe on human rights. We also need to involve the most affected communities in climate change solutions and ensure their voices are heard.

The potential impacts of these issues are well known, but the specific outcomes and how they will evolve are uncertain. As we navigate this future, we must be proactive in addressing these ethical considerations and strive for a world that is not only technologically advanced but also equitable and inclusive.",,,,,

Archive the SBIR/STTR Final Reports Submitted to NASA in the NASA STI Repository,Wicked Wild,,Low,"CAS Asked:  What hard problems should NASA Aeronautics leaders be aware of? 
Problem:  Transferring government funded research to industry is important, and to support entrepreneurship, NASA participates in the United States’ Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Programs. According to the United States’ Small Business Association’s (SBA) overview, the United States federal government disbursed $3.28 billion to seed new business to the SBIR program and $453 million through the STTR program in 2019.  Of that total, NASA’s portion for funding both the SBIR and STTR programs in 2019 was $183 million, as reported by the SBA.  Each organization receiving SBIR/STTR funds must submit a final report to NASA.  Unfortunately, these final reports are not easily accessible for study by the NASA technical workforce since they are currently not included in the NASA STI Repository.
 
Opportunity: SBIR/STTR Technical Monitors could submit final reports to the NASA STI Repository via the STRIVES process.   A new category of NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) for SBIR/STTR Final Reports could be created.  Since these reports would include company proprietary information, distribution would be limited to “NASA and NASA-contractors only” and electronic copies of the reports would be searchable on NTRSregistered.nasa.gov.

How might we enable trust in AI/ML applications and development,Wicked Wild,Low,Medium,"AI/ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AI/ML systems are very attractive targets [1]. An IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications [2]. A 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft, and adversarial samples [3]. AI/ML systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks across development, deployment, and inference. Enabling technologies: Public-key Encryption, Digital Signatures, Zero-knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, etc..
Characteristics that build trust: AI/ML systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy. Development of verifiable A/ML standards and regulations that rely on cryptographic guarantees to replace trust in companies.
Use cases:
Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML)
Problem: How to validate AI/ML accuracy of services on a public data set without exposing model weights and providing assurances related to training data
Solution: Zero Knowledge proofs
Proof of Inference
Problem: How to verify that an AI/ML service provider is running inference on the proper model and not cheaper model

AI/ML certification (e.g. how to verify model predictions are from certified model without exposing weights).

data pipelines, model development, model validation, and inference while maintaining privacy [1].

Source: [3] ‘Anticipate Data Manipulation Security Risks to AI Pipelines’, Gartner Research, Feb 2019.","the context for today's presentation is that AI ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AIML systems remain very attractive targets for these kind of adversarial attacks. So industry has kind of been looking at this and we I put here some examples where an IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications. And similarly, a 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft and adversarial examples.
So the key idea here is that AI ML systems are vulnerable to these adversarial attacks across the entire life cycle of development, deployment and inference. So you know, the idea here is that there's this intersection of AI, ML, and cryptography, and there's many different kind of business sectors that live at this intersection.
And we can kind of leverage some of these enabling technologies from cryptography such as public key encryption, data signature, zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption. And there's all these other ones as well. And so the idea is that leveraging these kind of cryptographic primitives would enable us to build trust in systems and enforce good behavior as opposed to relying on trusting some entity or company or third party. So characteristics that build trust in these systems are that AI Mel systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy.
And that's a big key. Their privacy and that, you know, the idea here is that development of verifiable AIML standards and regulations that rely on these cryptographic guarantees can replace trusting companies.
So some simple examples just to give some intuition behind the ideas here is that you know, everybody's probably used open AI's chat GPT. So when you send a request to chat GPT, how do you know that the answer you get back is from the correct model?
So say that you're a subscriber to their premium service. You pay $10.00 a month to get access to chat GPT 4 when open AI returns their response. How do you know that they're running inference on chat GPT 4 as opposed to a cheaper model that might be more kind of profitable from a business perspective? Well, the answer is that you don't know you are putting trust in open AI to do the right thing. So some the examples here of different use cases are one that I just talked about here was the 2nd bullet, which is proof of inference. So the idea there is that, you know, you can leverage some of these cryptographic tools to validate or verify that you ran inference on the correct model. Some other use cases are, you know, let's say a company says, hey, I have some machine learning model, it was this accurate. How do you how do you verify that their performance on some data set is what they claim, while in both those situations you can use these cryptographic tools called 0 knowledge proofs?
There's other tools that you can use, such as fully homomorphic encryption, that enable privacy preserving mill so you can do the idea there is you can encrypt data, send to a large data center, do compute on your encrypted data and get back the answer that you had to begin with. And then now there's some other ideas about kind of by hardware attestation and provenance to ensure integrity of data that are running through your pipelines. So ultimately the wicked wild idea here is that cryptographic primitives can be combined with a aiml development and applications to provide strong guarantees across data pipelines, model development, model validation and inference while maintaining privacy.",,,,
How might we cool next gen aircraft?,Wicked Wild,High,Medium,"Opportunity:Sustainable aviation is a key initiative for NASA and the world to address climate change and protect the environment. An opportunity is presented to leverage inherent thermal generation in aircraft operation, typically seen as waste, to support electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation.
Key Use Cases: Assist with thermal management, structural health monitoring, lighting systems, and de-icing.
Possible Partnerships: Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Joby, FAA, and more.  ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: 
Future aircraft will be fully integrated closed-loop systems:
Wasted energy from thermal, motion, and other energy sources will     
        be harvested for secondary functions to:
Enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives
Demonstrate integrated thermal management systems
Enable comprehensive structural health management
Energy harvesting will enable extended operations, reduce cost, reduce strain on systems, provide redundancy, and compliment ongoing sustainability efforts.
Leverage energy harvesting systems to support aircraft functions, optimize operational and energy efficiency through integrated systems, improve safety, and reduce waste.
Energy harvesting technologies and advanced materials are available, along with an opportunity to drive change in advanced air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion.
","I'm talking about heat generation. That's inherent to any process, and specifically in this context, the excess heat generated throughout an aircraft as NASA and countries around the globe look to sustainable aviation to address greener climate and environmental initiatives, we can also shift our perspective on heat generated by engines, batteries and other aircraft components from being a detriment or a flaw to the generated heat being designed feature. Here we have an opportunity to employ energy harvesting as part of an integrated multifunctional system to support our electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation, as well as moving a few degrees closer to closing the loop on sustainability. With that, we can address the desirability, viability and feasibility of taking on this opportunity.
As for the desirability, or do they want this energy conversion technology, this technologies as a part of an integrated aircraft system is not a new concept. NASA and companies like Boeing have previously demonstrated interest in the area at the bottom right, doctor Arun Malay of Boeing laid out an aircraft system map to demonstrate the potential of a thermal management system to capture and utilize generated heat, and even now with the the electrification, the aviation batteries introduced a significant source of thermal energy. That one harvested could support secondary systems while simultaneously mitigating and preventing thermal runaway and catastrophic damage. Supported systems could further include comprehensive structural health monitoring, lighting and deicing.
And this all contributes towards energy harvesting, enabling extended operations, reduce costs, reduce strain on systems, providing redundancy and complementing ongoing sustainability efforts. As for viability, or should we do this leveraging integrated energy harvesting? Harvesting systems will support aircraft functions, optimize operational and energy efficiency through integrated systems, improve safety and reduce waste, has for feasibility. Or can we do this? The technologies in advanced materials are available along with an opportunity to drive change in advance air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion. While they're still in the early stages of development, so with that, though wicked wild idea proposed here is a world where aircraft are multifunctional, fully integrated closed loop systems possibly. Imagine the nervous system of a body completely connected and optimized to regulate temperature and subsystem functions and aviation wasted energy from thermal motion and other energy sources will be harvested for secondary functions to enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives. Demonstrate integrated thermal management systems and enable comprehensive structural health management and we here at NASA have the multidisciplinary expertise needed to solve this challenge and make an impactful change to the state of green aviation.

So in order to do that, you kind of need a quantum network, just like the Internet up until now. Folks will say that you can right now you can log in onto a quantum computer, and that's true.

If you're, if you're developing a new medicine, you wouldn't want to log into a quantum computer, and then whoever's running it, be able to know what that is.

How might we democratize the Medical Supply chain through aviation? 
How might we regulate drones/democratized aviation in the future medical supply chain? 
Why is this a problem? 
The use of drones, or unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics has a range of potential strengths: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. However, large numbers of drones may affect other aircraft operating in the same local airspace, the infrastructure for the introduction of a significant number of drone systems does not exist, and there are significant number of regulatory and safety issues involved. Lack of technical expertise within regulating bodies on these subjects. And, there are a couple of real technological barriers that are wicked hard and nobody has tackled them [REF - The Big Case for Small UAS Access to the National Airspace System.pdf (sharepoint.com)]. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
UTM (Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management) system is being developed by NASA and FAA to safely and efficiently integrate drone operations into the national airspace system where other vehicles also fly. Increasing the capability of individual drones towards more complete on-board situational awareness to avoid safety hazards or impact to the airspace can shift the problem from one of centralized management to one of self-managed systems that do not require human intervention. SBIR (GH). 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
More advanced management capabilities of the air space will allow improved safety and efficiency. Technology development of drone and vehicle artificial intelligence, autonomy, internal/external vehicle situational awareness can impact drone capabilities on an individual level. Overall, the introduction of drones into the air space will change the nature of the airspace and begin the early phase of addressing these individual drone operational challenges 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?

"How might the entire aviation experience be restructured to reduce its risk as a vector of pathogen transmission? (reducing unnecessary contact, etc.)",Discovery,Medium,Medium,"Why is this a problem? 
The drive to reduce human interaction in aviation has at least 2 influencing factors: The attempt to safeguard public health from the spread of contagions; and an economic drive towards automation to decrease staffing and expense associated with airline and the airport employees. However, this can lead to the depersonalization of air travel and, depending on the efficiency of the automation, potential inefficiencies in handling customer complaints/problems as well as removing a public face representing and individual airline company. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134995/ 
https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1223&context=wmblr 
If the aviation industry is a major vector for pathogen transmission, it will continue to generate global pandemics as strict border control will be more porous than otherwise. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?
At the very least, the interactions of automated system should be at least as efficient as human based customer service. This implies improved artificial intelligence be implemented so that either unexpected events can be addressed or quickly re-routed to human staffing.
Additional interfaces need to be designed to be pathogen resistant in case cleaning is less effective or skipped.
Standard, practiced changes to routing and operations if pathogens are detected or a higher risk of transmission.
Additional changes to cabin design to mitigate risk.
Airport redesign to reduce transmission while waiting in line, etc.
Deployable pathogen detection inside airports and airplanes (i.e.?next gen temperature guns, mid-flight pathogen testing).

What trends might enable problem exploration and solutioning?  
(Worker to Passenger vectors) Automated check-in and self-serve kiosks have already become a standard aspect of flight service. This drive to minimize staffing and increase automation in customer service is already happening across multiple industries. Increasing automation and autonomous systems may result in airports in which the process is fully automated and one does not have to interact with a member of the airline or airport staff in order to board the plane. 
(Passenger to Passenger) Use of masks and availability of sanitizing wipes or fluids, post COVID, will set cultural norms to reduce P2P transmission.

This may be a technological progression that will first be implemented in the range of other industries before it reaches aviation. This may not be CAS-worthy problem because the market is already addressing automation (for costs).
But from the pathogen side and from the in-the-tube spread, automation doesn’t account for all interactions and may not even shield people from the most common mechanisms of pathogen transmission (because we don’t know what they are). From that perspective, CAS may have an valid entry point. There may be aircraft design and technology investments specific to the aircraft that may be worthwhile IF the pathogen transmissions is validated as a big problem. (See Capabilities list).",,,,,

Why is this a problem? 
Large portions of the US population, particularly those with the greatest health challenges, do not participate in clinical research studies and thus do not benefit from those discoveries. Low accrual issues overall are the cause of 55% of terminated clinical trials. This lack of representation compromises generalizability, hinders innovation, impacts trust in the medical system, and compounds health disparities of communities without access. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Often, clinical trials are centered around academic or research institutions limiting participation by a broader sampling of the population. Capabilities to address this problem revolve around improving the ability for patients to participate, or, effectively, bringing the clinical trial to the patients. 
For example, travel impacts out-of-pocket costs to patients, typically driving remote patients out of studies. Distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established as a cause of lack participation by rural communities. 
Thus, one capability to improve participation would be to increase the accessibility to transportation in rural communities. 
Further, telemedicine and virtual or localized trial treatments may broaden the geographic diversity. 
While some aspects of this transformation are more related to overall trends in health care technology, the ability to provide well equipped mobile airborne laboratories could impact the ability to increase participation in clinical trials in rural communities. 
Beyond issues related to location, there is in general a lack of participation by racial and ethnic minority populations for a variety of socio-economic reasons. Specific outreach may be required to these populations, so investment in greater capabilities in community coordination. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation to allow more democratized transportation and the ability to bring more comprehensive health care capabilities, including clinical trial participation, no I don’t to remote regions; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. 
The trend in cost of flying will dictate further difficulties in equity. Cost has decreased over multiple decades, but may be stabilizing now (need to confirm).

US Participation was 28% of the total representation in global Clinical trials in 2015. The problem in the US is also then a global representation problem. With personalized genetic mods, medicine, this will become worse. With Climate change, disease and medical impacts will also worsen in the most distressed areas and populations (not currently studied). Specific rural communities are impacted by this problem already within the US. For example, distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations who are more likely to live far away from research centers. 
Academic centers conduct 55% of the NIH extramural research and operate 98% of the cancer centers. Participation in these activities is biased by the proximity to these centers. However, more broadly, effective clinical trials as a method for improved treatment and drug development has an impact on the population as a whole. Limiting the effectiveness of these trials because of a lack of participation by significant population subgroups narrows the trial’s impact and reduces benefits to society beyond the immediate drug and research.

"How might aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to heavy metal manufacturing and usage? (advanced manufacturing, airport safety protocols, and aircraft design)",Discovery,Medium,Medium,"Sibling Question: 
How will aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to increased usage of antimicrobials in response to COVID-19? (airport safety protocols, and aircraft design) 
Why is this a problem?
Drug resistant bacteria is propagated by the use of heavy metals (lead, mercury, and silver) because of mining and transportation usage. Bacteria have evolved to resist the presence of these heavy metals, producing traits that also shield them from antibiotics. 
Normally heavy metals are lethal to bacteria because of the free emission of ions that disrupt cell functions. 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health and development threat. It requires urgent multisectoral action in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
WHO has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. 
Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. 
Lack of clean water and sanitation and inadequate infection prevention and control promotes the spread of microbes, some of which can be resistant to antimicrobial treatment. 
The cost of AMR to the economy is significant. In addition to death and disability, prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays, the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted. 
Without effective antimicrobials, the success of modern medicine in treating infections, including during major surgery and cancer chemotherapy, would be at increased risk.

Improper cold chain handling - 50% of all temp excursions due to airport handling – drive medical costs 
Lost opportunity for aviation industry to participate in the medical products transport chain. Lack of standardization across the aviation industry has seen the medical cargo transportation sector losing out to other modes of transportation, such as road and sea. 
This can be addressed by restoring reliability and safety across the medical cargo supply chain. 
The primary issue is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive medical cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
The whole supply chain in the air cargo industry involves a lot of handling points of the cargo. 
There are a lot of different stakeholders that handle the cargo and each individual link in the chain needs to be up to standard, otherwise the whole quality of the supply chain can be lost.

But despite an increasing demand for transporting medicine worldwide, the sector has been falling behind other modes of transportation such as shipping or road, due to a lack of compliance, standardization, accountability and transparency across the supply chain. The air cargo share of global pharma products transport has declined from 17% in 2000 to 11% in 2013, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) notes. 
The reason behind the decline is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
Over 50% of all temperature excursions occur while products are in the hands of airlines and airports, according to IATA, which renders the products worthless or even dangerous for patients. 
However, according to the Seabury Group, just 0.5 million tonnes of pharmaceutical products are transported by air every year, compared to 3.5 million tonnes by sea. 
Annual product losses associated with these problems range from $2.5-$12.5bn, a figure that IATA describes as “unacceptably high in a $300 billion a year market”.** _ 
The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50% of vaccines are wasted globally every year; a large part because of lack of temperature control and the logistics to support an unbroken cold-chain. 
At the scale of COVID-19, this spoilage rate could waste potentially a billion vaccines, which, even if valued at a non-profit cost of around $10 a vaccine, represents a staggering wasted investment. 
Cracking the cold chain challenge is key to making vaccines ubiquitous (theconversation.com)

New curriculum programs will be needed to train mechanics how to troubleshoot, diagnose, and repair aircraft that use liquid hydrogen fuel and electric batteries. Type qualifications for hydrogen aircraft would likely require training for working with cryogenics, management of explosive fuels, and new compressor designs. Likewise mechanics obtaining a type qualification for electric aircraft (and eVTOLs) will need to taught the best practices for maintaining electric aircraft engines, their high-voltage batteries, and their coolant systems.
Training schools and universities that routinely graduate certified AMTs and A&Ps will likely adapt to the changing maintenance landscape organically. Striving to produce the most competitive mechanics, these organizations will likely lead the charge in the race to develop curriculums that prepare graduates to work with these new aircraft. However, many maintenance companies that contract out labor to airlines and flight service centers will likely lag behind owing to the fact that the bulk of their existing business is to service conventional aircraft. However, if the AAM market gains dominance, and hydrogen and electric aircraft begin to compete for A&Ps, then the in-service workforce will need to seek out supplemental training programs that will teach them how to work on these new aircraft. 
It is foreseeable that a large, well distributed, network of A&Ps will be required to maintain the growing airline and AAM fleets of the future. These mechanics will be essential to ensure that both airline and AAM operations are efficient, timely, and safe. This may be especially true at smaller regional airports and vertistops where there could be little to no supporting infrastructure and where damaged/inoperable aircraft would critically disrupt or halt flight operations until the aircraft is serviced.

Securing the Future Aviation Workforce,Discovery,,Medium,"Background – Workforce in Aviation
The Geneva-based Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) estimates that the aviation industry is supported by roughly 87.7 million workers globally [1]. 
11.3m directly support the industry: airport ops, airlines, manufacturing, and navigation (i.e., ATC). 
18.1m indirectly support aviation: fuel, logistics, supply chains, retail, customer support, IT.
13.5m are induced by the industry: banks, restaurants, ancillary consumer goods focused on aviation.
44.8m are classified as “aviation-enabled tourism”: hotels, resorts, charters, etc.
There is currently a pilot shortage that is a result of both COVID-19 and a wave of early and mandatory senior pilot retirements [2]. At Delta, 20% of its staff took buyout packages or early retirement offered in response to COVID-19 [5]. One of the largest flight instruction companies, CAE, has estimated that more than 264,000 new pilots will be needed over the next 10 years. Likewise, Boeing estimates that 612,000 new pilots, 626,000 maintenance technicians, and 886,000 crew members will be needed to support the aviation industry over the next 20 years [3]. Further more, some estimates state that the AAM industry will demand of approximately 60,000 pilots by the year 2028 [4].
The industry is working to address these staffing shortages but with limited success. Some estimates suggest that the sector will be short 80,000 pilots by 2032 [6]. If AAM does develop into a competitive employer of pilots, there is no known method to secure the number of pilots required using today’s training pipeline.
Some companies within the aviation industry are looking to reduce their staffing requirements by adopting to policies such as Single Pilot Operations (SPO) in combination with heightened levels of automation. Many AAM startups hope to one day offer completely autonomous air travel to their customers, eliminating the need for a human pilot entirely. 
The complete impacts on the future of the global and aviation workforces remain difficult to define. Several of the key elements that will drive the workforce of the future are largely out of government / corporate control. Changes in public sentiment towards work, and its role within their lives, are difficult to forecast or control. 
However, there are elements where we could see considerable impacts arise naturally…
Automation: Advances in autonomous autopilots could obviate the need for pilots in commercial aircraft [1]. Such advances could reduce the needed number of pilots an airline would need to employ. Further more, it has been speculated that automation within aviation maintenance could provide operational performance benefits in addition to labor substitution [2]. This shift could potentially shutter long-standing training schools/companies who depend on the high volume of pilots / maintenance students moving into the industry. 
AI: Smarter software products that feature advanced AI could significantly reduce the amount of time and effort that is needed to complete many computer-based tasks that are currently accomplished by humans [3]. Such examples could include: fleet personnel management, flight routing and dispatching, aircraft modeling and design, simulation and validation, etc.
AAM: Speculations regarding the size of AAM fleets and their pilot demands vary. Some organizations estimate that as many as 60,000 AAM pilots could be needed by 2028 [4]. This surge in demand could severely restrict how many pilots large airlines could recruit, leading to increased scheduling delays, cancelations, and lost revenues. 
How might the aviation industry establish competitive recruitment programs, college and flight training scholarships, and engagement efforts within high schools and universities to secure the future of the aviation industry and its workforce?
Will AAM pilots be represented by a pilots union?
How competitive will AAM pilot compensation programs be? Will airlines be able to compete for talent and expertise using their in-service compensation model?
How will advanced AI impact the staffing requirements of Airlines’ dispatch departments?
How will autonomous flight impact the staffing requirements of ATC centers?
How will autonomous flight impact the roles and responsibilities of human pilots in the cockpit? Will the need for human pilots be eliminated? 
What new industries will need to be established to support AAM operations? 
How will a permanent shift of employees into remote work postures impact the aviation industry?
What skill and expertise gaps exist within the design and engineering domains of aviation today? Will those gaps be exacerbated or solved by an increasingly specialized workforce?
Will companies devote time and resources to help reskill the workforce they have? Or will companies abandon their current employees and hire new, already trained, workers who possess the skills and knowledge that are needed to advance the company’s agenda?",,,,,
Advancing Water Security,Discovery,,Medium,"Background – How water is used in Aviation
The earth has 1.3 BsqKM of water. 97% is salt water, 3% is freshwater. However, only 1.2% of all freshwater is available for use. The remainder is either stored as ice, in deep aquifers, or the atmosphere [1,2].  Of all water used globally, the agriculture sector is the largest single user (68%). The industrial sector, including most of the aviation industry, uses about 12%.
The amount of water that is used by the aviation industry varies widely and is domain specific. For instance, the manufacturing side of the aviation industry has a different water use footprint than the airport operations side. 
Historically, Airbus has reported that they use 1 Bgal of water per year [3]. This is approximately equal to the daily water demands of New York City or Chicago. Where as a single airport’s water footprint can range from  9 – 43 liters per passenger (table 2) [4].
A key step to achieving Zero Impact Aviation will be to establish Airport Water Resource Management Plans that have ambitious water efficiency goals that minimize the amount of water that is consumed system wide. These plans [5,6]
Background – Water Use in Aviation
Of all water used globally, the agriculture sector is the largest single user (68%) of fresh water [1]. They heavily rely on two classifications of water:
Green Water -  Water that is found in top-soil; replenished by natural rainfall.
Blue Water – Water that is manually irrigated; drawn from waterways and underground aquifers.
Demand for blue water irrigation is the largest drain on aquifers across the globe as farms struggle to provide their crops with enough water. Areas of the planet that have historically been able to rely on green water (i.e., reliable rainfall) will need to rely even more heavily on the use of irrigation. As a result, many of the worlds most vital aquifers are being depleted at unsustainable rates that are leading to levels of water scarcity that have a direct impact on the quantify of food that can be cultivated each year [2]. 
The aviation industry is continuing to invest in SAFs and bio-fuels. By doing so, they are also increasing the demand for blue water irrigation that is needed to grow the crops that will be converted into fuels. The aviation industry’s demand for biofuels will hasten the depletion of key aquifers that are essential for food production.
As the aviation industry transitions away from jet fuel to alternative energy sources, it will need to understand and reconcile with the impact its energy needs have on water availability. 
Background – Planetary Boundaries (Freshwater)
In 2009, the Stockholm Resilience Centre worked with a group of renowned scientists to identify and quantify the processes that stabilize and provide resilience to our planet. The scientists proposed nine quantitative planetary boundaries (shown at the right). Operating within these boundaries enables humanity to continue to thrive. Crossing these boundaries can increase the risk of generating large-scale abrupt of irreversible environmental changes. [2]
In 2022, scientists reassessed how they were quantifying the freshwater boundary to include green water. Green water links the freshwater boundary to other boundaries like land-system change, biodiversity, and climate change. 
Green water is the main source of water to produce “food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy.” [4]. Scarcity of green water, while often overlooked in research, will impact the ability to scale up green energy alternatives like SAFs or hydrogen without impacting food security.  
When powered by bio-fuels (i.e., SAFs), aircraft are the most water intensive form transportation. One study estimated that bio-fuel powered aircraft demand 65 – 136 liters of water, per passenger, per kilometer traveled. In some cases, flying with biofuels has four times the water footprint of bio-fuel powered passenger vehicles [5]. This finding implies that switching to bio-fuels to power the aviation industry could have an outsized impact on the demand of water compared to alternative forms of transport. 
However, even non-biofuel alternatives, such as hydrogen have a large water footprint. Water UK’s Net Zero 2030 Roadmap estimates that if hydrogen emerges as an alternate fuel, than water demand will increase by 15 – 20%. [9] Some estimates suggest that global hydrogen industry’s demand for fresh water will grow from 1.5 bcm to 25 bcm by 2050 [2]. 1 bcm = 1 billion cubic meters (i.e., 264.2 billion gallons). [10] 25 bcm of water is approximately the municipal water need of 62 million people (Pop. of California and Florida combined).
Availability of fresh water varies across the world. RO desalination appears to provide the most economic path towards providing the feedstock for this process. However, RO and its alternative, thermal distillation, will place an increased demand on the power grid, impose considerable land use concerns, and have waste byproducts (e.g., brine) that require treatment and disposal. [8]
Projected Impacts
Water shortages leading to water scarcity - the UN estimates that by 2030, half the population will live in high water stressed areas. [6] 
Food scarcity due to decreased agricultural capacity – A 2012 ICA report judged that the depletion of groundwater supplies in some agricultural areas—owing to poor management—will pose a risk to both national and global food markets in the near-term [4]
Economic decline –Production of water-intensive goods like water, food, and clothing could be limited. Moreover, agriculture and industry will be limited due to a lack of freshwater access. [7]
Inadequate sanitation, leading to deadly diarrheal diseases and water-borne illnesses [2]
Increased global migration and displacement – some 700 million people could be displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030 [5]
Increased global conflict, including social disruption, political instability, and water being used as leverage. Latin America is already seeing these disputes and this unrest first-hand. [4] [9]
Increased threat of riots and other turmoil – during Cape Town’s countdown to Day Zero, they were warned that the water crisis presented a “threat to social order,” and could lead to civil strife and increased crime [8]
Destruction of habitats and loss of biodiversity
Rationale 
As the aviation industry transitions to alternative fuels, significant consideration must be given to the impact that will have on water availability. Although this is a looming problem, there is little focus on addressing this challenge now as most of the effort is focused on addressing the alligator closest to the boat, carbon emissions. 
CAS has the ability to help the aviation industry get ahead of this problem by exploring mitigation paths, alternative SAF options that utilize minimal water, researching the potential impact of the hydrogen economy. Further exploration is also needed on the impact of increased domestic mining on water availability and water quality. 
This is a tremendously wicked problem due, in part, to its high level of uncertainty. It is unclear to what extent aviation emissions play a role in water pollution. Nor is it clear how to properly balance the food-energy-water nexus in service of both our climate change goals and our need to ensure food and water systems remain secure.
The importance of water availability cannot be overstated. Water is our lifeblood. Still, as critical as this topic is, its connection to the aviation sector is tenuous. Several team members ranked it in lower in terms of value because they viewed it as not being a core area for NASA or they viewed water availability as being a fairly minimal area of concern for aviation at this time.",,,,,
Rethinking Aviation's Approach to Waste,Discovery,,Medium,"Background
“Green” aviation is an ambitious vision but can be messy in execution. Often, decisions made in the name of sustainable aviation are mired with unintended consequences and unfortunate trade-offs. 
For example, airlines toss 9,000 tons of plastic annually. Reducing the plastic used in catering operations would seem like an easy win, but it’s not that simple. Plastic has its advantages too. Plastic is lightweight, which translates to a reduction in carbon emissions as compared to glass and cutlery. Moreover, use of plastic in catering is more sanitary, reducing the spread of infectious disease. [1]
Similarly, shifts to electric aviation will reduce emissions significantly, but result in an “e-waste timebomb.” [2] Many of the current processes for recycling the necessary batteries are energy intensive and not designed for the scale that will be required. 
This problem is shared by other “green” energy resources like solar panels and wind turbines, which will be necessary to power the electrification of aviation. Wind turbines and aircraft decommissioning, in particular, face very comparable problems. Well-intentioned policies to increase energy efficiency, result in wind turbines being sent to landfills long before their expected lifecycle has ended. [5] Similarly, many planes are likely to be decommissioned at a faster rate than usual in order to shift to newer designs that will curtail emissions. Each generation of aircraft is typically 15-20% more fuel-efficient than the one it replaces. It is likely that older aircraft will be retired earlier in order to gain these fuel efficiencies and each net-zero pledges. [5], [6], [7] 
Much like wind turbines, the composite materials used in newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft designs are difficult to recycle. Both composite aircraft and wind turbines are difficult to recycle effectively and cheaply, meaning that wind turbine blades often end up sitting in landfills or buried in landfills. Unless significant effort is made to advance the processes and management plans for these types of materials, the same may be the case for composite aircraft when they reach end of life. [8] At present, 85% – 93% of aircraft components are recyclable, but those numbers may change as composite aircraft reach end-of-life. [10] [11]
Challenges
Many of the processes for recycling these materials are still in their infancy. Research into recycling composite materials and photovoltaics, for instance, has been had some early success, but additional work is needed to ready these processes for full-scale implementation.[1] [12] 
The recycling technology itself can sometimes be environmentally damaging, relying on harsh chemicals and energy intensive processes such as the case with battery recycling. [6] [11]
Efforts to reduce waste can be inefficient and ineffective. Compostable cutlery is only beneficial insofar as the cutlery actually gets composted. In many cases, however, there are rarely any clearly defined process or standards to ensure materials are diverted from landfills into recycling plants or compost centers. Waste management tools and systems are needed to ensure that components are disposed of properly. [2] [3]
Meeting the climate change challenge necessitates rapid innovation to continually build better batteries, aircraft, wind turbines, and solar panels. This fluctuation can be a deterrent to investing in end-of-life processing. For example, a company may be hesitant to invest in recycling Li-ion batteries while the future of the market is still relatively unstable. If Li air or hydrogen fuel cells takes off instead, the demand for Li-ion could crash. Even Li-ion batteries themselves often vary greatly with regards to composition, which can make recycling challenging. [11] 
The financial incentives to invest in recycling certain “green” materials like solar panels are low. Many of the materials, like glass, are low-value and the long life-span of the panels reduces the ROI. It costs $20 - $30 to recycle one solar panel, but sending the same panel to the landfill costs only $1 - $2. [4] Even in the case of battery recycling where many of the components are high-value, recycling plants are often costly to build and require sophisticated equipment to treat the harmful emissions that are a byproduct of the smelting process. [11]
Projected Impacts – Going to Waste
The waste generated by the aviation industry is significant. Left unmanaged, much of this waste will end up in landfills where, in the best case, it simply goes to waste. In the worst case, however, this material has the potential to be harmful to our environment and to our health. 

A healthy aviation ecosystem will require the ability to scale up recycling and end-of-life processing capacity. Demand for many of these resources is exceptionally high and they are increasingly difficult to come by due to geopolitical issues and supply chain concerns. Building a robust and circular aviation economy aimed at reducing waste across its value stream will be critical to ensuring continued growth and the ability to meet net-zero goals. 

There is tremendous projected growth in aviation waste in the coming years due to several factors, including efforts to meet net-zero emissions, which will result in an influx of new energy infrastructure, more fuel-efficient aircraft, and shifts to alternative energy sources. Covid-19 is an additional factor of consideration. Airlines are expected to increase the retirement rate of aircraft by 10 – 15% due to the pandemic. [4] Qantas and other airlines have delayed milestone goals to reduce single use plastics because of the sanitation benefits provided by them. [1] [3]

Industry is anticipating and investing in this growth, as evidenced by investment in battery recycling labs like Redwood and Battery Resourcers and by DOE’s investment in the ReCell lab. Moreover, collaboration between North American Aerospace Industries (NAAI), Aries Aerospace, and the Aircraft Interior Recycling Association are pushing toward 100% recyclable aircraft. [5] [6] This shift in thinking about recyclability is evidenced even in newer start-ups like Boom supersonic, who are incorporating recyclability into their initial design process [7]. Aerospace scrap is the fastest-growing source of carbon fiber in terms of value. [8]
Projected Impacts – Environment and Human Health
Waste from the aviation lifecycle ends up in landfills, aircraft boneyards, or storage facilities. The use of these spaces to accommodate this waste often means damaging or reducing natural habitats for wildlife. [3]
With regard to plastic waste, only 9% of aviation’s single use plastic waste is recycled, meaning that a huge percentage of this waste ends up in landfills or in the ocean. Landfilling has been shown to cause the accumulation of plastics in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. [7] This plastic leakage can impact everything from crop yield to the increased spread of pathogens through the “plastisphere”. [8], [9], [10]
Microplastics, a result of mismanaged plastic waste being worn down into smaller pieces, have infiltrated the ocean, the rain, and even the human body. Just this spring, scientists found microplastics in donor blood and inside the lungs of two surgical patients. Scientists are still researching whether these microplastics are harmful to human health. [4] 
Waste can be toxic or hazardous to human health. In the case of solar panels, for instance, toxic metals like lead, chromium, and cadmium can be harmful to humans are likely to leak from electronic waste dumps into drinking water supplies. [1]
Further, when not disposed of properly, lithium-ion batteries pose a safety risk. These batteries are composed of volatile compounds, capable of sparking spontaneously. [6]
The reuse and recycling of many of these materials also reduces environmental degradation from mining and the geopolitical and human rights issues associated with sourcing many of these materials. As shown in the chart on the bottom left, China has significant control over the production of many of these materials, which the Biden administration has acknowledged means that we “risked losing our edge as a nation.” [11]
Rationale
CAS has the potential to rethink aviation’s approach to “waste.” Helping to shift the thinking around these waste products so that they are seen as valuable resources. This is a growing problem that has the potential to turn into a near-term solution to help bolster aviation’s supply chain and enable the sector to continue growing. Moreover, aviation waste has the potential to open new markets and lines of revenue for manufacturers and airlines, adding additional resilience during unexpected downturns like the pandemic. This is an urgent problem/opportunity area. Although there is some energy focused on this topic area, many of the ongoing efforts are focused on our current understanding of the aviation lifecycle, including current compositions of EV batteries (Li-ion) and existing aircraft. Pursuing this topic area would mean broadening the focus beyond this current state to envision end-of-life for the aviation well into the future. It would also open the aperture to include energy infrastructure waste.   
Recommended Next Steps and Critical Questions
What do we propose as a next step?  Broad problem formulation and opportunity area discovery using a synthesis is recommended for exploring waste management for the future aviation lifecycle. This topic area would benefit greatly from leveraging previous work in development of OCRs during the Energy Needs for AAM at Scale Synthesis. Specifically, OCRs related to Battery Recyclability and Bio-designed Aircraft would be most relevant. 
In a separate vein, convening a cross-sector collaboration between the aviation, automotive, and wind turbine industries may enable breakthroughs and more concerted research on recyclability of CFRP. 

What questions would we like to explore further? As we look toward the future of aviation, we should be thinking about how to structure the aviation lifecycle in a way that mirrors the waste hierarchy and helps push the sector toward a resilient circular economy. Some initial elements to consider include:
How can we design our components such that we are preventing the use of critical materials like lithium and cobalt where possible?
How can we increase the longevity of these components? 
How might we scale and build toward flexible recycling processes capable of processing a wide-range of components?
How do we design and incentivize a circular aviation economy?
What other aircraft wastes have yet to be optimized? 
How might we design new aircraft that can still make use of old parts?
What would an aircraft that was 100% recyclable look like?

Improving Connectivity and Resilience of Aviation Amid Climate Change,Discovery,,Medium,"Background
Air transport helps drive the development and growth of our modern life. It provides the means to connect us to one another quickly, reliably, and safely. Air freights bring us flowers from Kenya, play a critical role in distributing vital medical supplies like the covid-19 vaccine, and expedite our supply chain. [3]
Aviation facilitates tourism, trade, and economic growth. Air transport is a major global employer, supporting 65.5 million jobs. The industry is responsible for roughly 2.7 trillion in global GDP. [1] [2] It improves the standard of living, alleviates poverty, connects remote communities, and enables a rapid response in the face of crisis. In 2021 alone, aviation proved to be a critical service in mitigating catastrophes and reconnecting the world.[3]
Aviation has proven to be a critical resource in enabling responsive action in the face of humanitarian crises and natural disasters. Aircraft are not only used to help respond to natural disasters like hurricanes but also to track and study them. [1] Most recently, air transport ensured safe and efficient evacuation out of Afghanistan and Ukraine. Air transport also facilitates the provision of humanitarian aid in the form of food and other commodities. [1] [4] [5]
As advancements in aviation make it more accessible, ubiquitous, and flexible – how can we use air transport to improve our quality of life? This topic area would focus on the power of connecting people and goods, enabling recreation and leisure time, and ensuring aviation remains able to respond to humanitarian crises and natural disasters.

When we consider the power of the future of aviation to connect and improve our lives, we may want to look at an “extreme user” as an example. Steven Rothstein purchased an unlimited, lifetime pass in 1987 – AAirpass, enabling him to fly anywhere in the world for the rest of his life. Over the course of 20 years, he accumulated some 30 million miles.
His son notes that traveling as frequently as they did made him feel “as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.” His father treated major hubs as if they were his offices, traveling to Amsterdam, Australia, India, and Japan with incredibly frequency. Airports, in turn, became his home. [1]
Steven used his AAirpass to indulge and experience, but also to build relationships. He gifted his accumulated miles to dozens and dozens of people he encountered along his travels, helping them to visit sick relatives, or to create meaningful experiences. In one such instance, he gifted miles to a group of priests so that they could fly to Italy to see the Vatican. [1] 
This story is a microcosm of how a more ubiquitous and accessible air transport system might change how we connect with the world and the people in it. The future airport may resemble your office or your home. Major international cities and yet-to-be developed ones may be visited with the frequency of regional domestic hubs. Strong connections and relationships may be made across state or country lines.
Compare that vision with the fact that a recent survey found that roughly 11% of Americans have not traveled outside of the state in which they were born. Imagine how impactful a more accessible and ubiquitous air transport system could be – broadening their horizons, fostering an understanding and appreciation of different cultures, and promoting global connections.[3]

Projected Impacts
It can be difficult to quantify the impact of some of the improvements air transport makes in our quality of life. We can say with certainty that air transport enables us to be more responsive in the fact of crises and increases our access to opportunities, experiences, business ventures, educations, medical services, and cultures that we may not otherwise have been able to enjoy. 
As we look to the future, aviation has the power to focus on continuing to improve other aspects of our quality of life, by making air transport more ubiquitous, accessible, and applicable to various challenges. Consider, for instance, the role aviation may play in reducing our commute times and decongesting our roadways – a factor which would enable many of us to experience more leisure time and reduce the stresses of mass transit.
Aviation has the potential to tackle many challenges within our modern world, including:
Urban design – helping us to shift to more walkable and connected cities
Education – bringing the world to life by increasing our access to it
Natural disasters and humanitarian crises – anticipating and responding to crises efficiently and effectively
Broadening our horizons – in a world that is increasingly global, how do we reconcile our own insular worldview? Aviation has the power to enable the public to experience more parts of the world in order to deepen their understanding of it. 

Rationale 
The responsiveness and connectivity that air transport provides will become increasingly critical in the face of climate crises, supply chain issues, ongoing and future pandemics, and our increasing desire for convenience, connection, and customization. 
Aviation is at the convergence of these trends and potential threats. How do we leverage the opportunity provided by advancements in aviation to improve our quality of life?

Reducing Harms and Increasing Benefits to Ecology,Discovery,,Medium,"Many current conservation efforts in the aviation sector focus on reducing disturbances caused by noise and light pollution and potential wildlife strikes. These efforts are primarily focused on impacts to wildlife surrounding airports or airfields. 
To achieve the vision of Zero-Impact Aviation, we must:
Expand these efforts out to include the full aviation lifecycle. The impacts of mining and sourcing of materials on local ecology must be accounted for and built into sustainability efforts.   
Understand and address how the growth and expansion of aviation might impact local ecology through the increased transfer of invasive species, plant pathogens, and disease carrying insects. 

Background
This topic area reflects a shift in focus around impacts to local ecology to account for anticipated future growths in aviation and an expansion of thinking regarding the aviation lifecycle. 
First, as aviation becomes more ubiquitous and accessible through the advent of AAM, the disturbances to local ecology are likely to grow in kind. The noise and light pollution disturbances will no longer be isolated to airfields, but expanded out into urban, rural, and suburban environments. 
This growth in aviation will likely correlate with a growth in the worldwide aviation network (WAN). The growth of the WAN has been linked to increases in the rates of biological invasion, including invasive insects, plant pathogens, and disease carrying mosquitoes. 
Traffic and climate are shown to be constraints to this spread, but as international passenger numbers are projected to rise in conjunction with global temperatures, those constraints are increasingly uncertain. Passenger air travel is shown to be the predominate introduction vector in low-Human Development Index (HDI) regions. International air travel has been identified as a significant factor in the movement of economically damaging pest species, with 73% of recorded pest interceptions in the US occurring at airports. 
Second, many industries, including airlines, are beginning to expand their sustainability efforts to include the full lifecycle of their product or operation. Aviation is no different. Airlines like Cathay Pacific, Delta, and United are all thinking more broadly about their impacts. In the case of local ecology, a Zero-Impact Aviation effort should expand efforts to protect wildlife across the full aviation lifecycle, including mining and sourcing of materials. 
The green energy revolution is reliant on raw materials like cobalt and lithium, which are currently sourced through mining efforts. While a circular economy may be possible one day, efforts to scale these green industries up quickly are far outpacing advancements in recyclability. 
Zero-Impact Aviation should look beyond aviation operations when considering impacts to local ecology to include potential impacts of sourcing and mining these raw materials. 

Projected Impacts
Impacts to migratory patterns, habitats, and the potential increase of invasive species all pose a significant threat to ecosystem health and biodiversity. These impacts are particularly important in a changing climate, where healthy ecosystems provide the resilience necessary to adapt and continue functioning effectively and efficiently. 
Biodiversity is not just critical for healthy environments, it also supports human and social needs, including food and nutrition security, energy, development of medicines and pharmaceuticals and freshwater. 
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports that ""the current annual environmental, economic, and health-related costs of invasive species exceed those of all other natural disasters combined.” Alien species are the second leading cause of extinction in the US and cost approximately $120 billion annually. These invasions can threaten ecosystems, carry infectious disease, and reduce agricultural productivity, leading to food scarcity. 

Impact on Wildlife
There are a tremendous amount of unknowns regarding how aviation’s growth and expansion will impact local wildlife and biodiversity.  Decisions being made today in the name of sustainable aviation may threaten the sustainability of our healthy ecosystems tomorrow. More information is needed regarding the trade-offs of these decisions and the impact around the larger aviation lifecycle. Finally, aviation may prove useful in addressing many of these same challenges. Is it possible to leverage aviation as a conservation tool?

Opportunity:Describe the problem NASA should be solving.  The description can also include notional desirability, key use cases, possible partnerships.NASA Aeronautics’ mission may predate NASA itself, but it continues to attack the aviation barriers of today and tomorrow, ensuring continued progress and growth.  A wide array of new entrants to aviation are working to transform aviation with new concepts, technologies and business models.  The initial challenges of how to certify their novel aircraft concepts have dominated efforts to date, but there are other, larger barriers to transforming aviation that NASA should be attacking.
At the recent Imagninaviation conference, the challenge of “industrializing” these new vehicles was highlighted as “the big risk” in this space. It’s a risk that exists where a vehicle’s design and manufacturing intersect with how it can be operated routinely, subject to the realities and economics of commercial flight services.  Will these new aircraft be able to function well enough, quickly enough, to earn a place in industry?  
My claim is that NASA and ARMD should have a significant role in reducing the time, cost, and effort to clear that barrier.  The USA should be the best place for aviation start-ups to innovate.  Shouldn’t we be helping to significantly reduce the “growth stage capital” needed by U.S. aviation startups to “industrialize” new aircraft designs?   If that’s not on ARMD’s plate, “Why not?”

Industry Perspectives

“It's one thing to create a product that works the way it's supposed to every time. It's another thing to create an operation that works the way it's supposed to every time. 
And that's from start to finish — from how the product is designed, manufactured, flown, maintained, and then how, at the end of the day, provides a service to a customer.”
Okeoma Moronu - Aviation & Regulatory Lead, Zipline
Industry Perspectives
“Can I just build on something that Graham said that is pretty important here. One of the things that I said I was excited about was the availability of capital, but one of the things I'm most concerned about is the availability of capital. Because, to Graham's point, in order for us to accelerate the rate of development, and for more than just a couple of these small companies to survive to get bought by Boeing and Airbus, there needs to be growth stage capital available. That's a real concern, right?
When I was kind of diligence-ing a bunch of these guys to see who I would work with, one of the real things that struck me was that people have not thought through industrialization. This is where the very light jet market went bad, right? Eclipse was like, ""Hey, I'll deliver a sub-million-dollar jet, which was fine. They could build a sub-million-dollar prototype, but when it came to actually industrialize that vehicle, it was two to three times the cost and there was no market for that for that product at that price. That is the risk here as well, right?
So, we have big promises for the electric VTOL space but when it comes [time] to actually build and industrialize these vehicles, there's very little institutional experience outside of Boeing, Airbus, and now Embraer and Bombardier. There's been such intense consolidation in the industry, that that experience does not reside in a lot of places. 
So for me, that's the big risk to this space.

At the companies I work with, we think a lot about, ""What can we learn from automotive to shorten the timeline and bring these things to market?”  PK, you and I talk a lot about supply chain and how do we foster the development of an ecosystem in a way that that doesn't result in sort of a duopoly again in this space.
So that, for me, is the big thing. I think there's a lot to do to transition from...you know, on some level, anyone can build a flying prototype. But to then take that and build it into a production scale vehicle that can meet that 10-9 redundancy requirement is super hard, super super hard. It's super super hard and super capital intensive and the question is, ""Where is the money going to come from?"" It is a very real one. Not to bring the enthusiasm down, just a moderate reality check.”

“...especially if we start looking at even more advanced configurations of hybrid electrics or all electric configurations where the human response time being able to deal with an off-nominal condition is just not fast enough.
Therefore, you need higher levels of automation to be able to keep a safe flight profile (or you have to bring the flight engineer back and I don't think that's a viable option).  That's essentially, from the vehicle perspective, what we are really looking at: How do we develop the future vehicle safety systems?
Looking at it from the airline operation center perspective and the SMS, we have a Safety Management System that's been the envy of the world, and everybody's been copying it.  We have ASIAS and CAST and the Europeans are just trying to start.  They don't have an active ASIAS or CAST equivalent, so we are leading the world and that has led the United States to have the safest aviation system in the world.
However, in the current system we still are looking at a more post-flight diagnostic environment. Given the future construct, we want to move more towards a prognostic environment. How are you able to use automation to identify precursors to potential events and then automatically mitigate them, because right now we have done pretty good job of identifying post-flight events. In the current research that we have right now, we're able to identify and propose solutions to potential real-time events (or in-time events because some things don't have to be real time), but we really are trying to move towards automated mitigation as well, because the mitigation in the current environment is still left up to the human.
Given the future capabilities coming up the line, the human response time is just not going to be enough, both in terms of speed as well as the complexity of the systems and everything else.  This is where the additional automation is needed as you look at that safety element of the vehicle system and the aviation system performance. 
I said the word ""auto"" a lot, so that means now you have to start looking at the V&V of this new automation system! As you can see, it's a cascading multi-pronged effort that we're leading here, within NASA, to say: OK, how do we build the vehicle system itself? How do we make sure that it's able to operate? How do we make sure it's safe and then how do we make sure that the system automation and autonomy can actually be economically developed, deployed, and certified? It's a very multi-pronged effort.”

Smart Structures and Systems Across Aviation and Civil Infrastructure ,Discovery,,Very High,"Research into smart structures and systems can provide critical insights: how might we shift to proactive maintenance of critical structures to reduce weight, increase uptime, and  
improve longevity? 

Advancements to smart structures and systems can improve safety and enable cost-effective decision making in maintenance and repair, both for aircraft and for civil infrastructure such as structurally deficient bridges. This is a case where aviation technology can learn from early adopters in civil infrastructure inspection and monitoring, and use NASA's engineering expertise to advance this technology area for mutual benefit.  

In this opportunity concept report (OCR), we describe prospective research avenues in smart structures and systems to improve aircraft monitoring and inspection, with mutual benefit to bridge monitoring. We’ve also included a narrative survey of the problem space in bridge monitoring and aircraft health management stemming from findings during a site visit, conversations with subject matter experts, and targeted literature review. The survey has emphasis on relevant technologies, economic impact, feasibility, regulatory environment, and alignment with NASA’s mission. 

Three solution vectors are outlined: (1) unmanned aircraft system (UAS) based automated inspection, (2) wireless distributed sensing, and (3) digital twin for reliability management. The UAS-based inspection and wireless distributed sensing complement each other’s strengths in providing safety improvements, with potential for disruptive economic impact by reducing maintenance costs and increasing aircraft longevity. Similar advantages apply to bridge and other infrastructure monitoring and inspection. An assessment of prospective research areas in the maturation path is provided, for example: system integration, demonstration cases, leveraging complementary inspection modalities, data format representation, and visualization needs.  

Core research and development areas emphasize aspects related to prototyping, system integration, demonstration for aeronautics impact, and digital twin development for cross-cutting use cases. The opportunity area includes significant potential for partnership across NASA groups, across programs, with other governmental agencies, with commercial entities, and with academic institutions. This area provides a unique opportunity for collaboration with the civil engineering research community, providing for cross-pollination between two seemingly disparate fields that are targeting similar underlying technological advancements. 

Investment in this technology area fits under “system-wide safety assurance” in NASA’s core strategic objective “Drive efficient and sustainable aviation” ?[1]?. NASA's ""for the benefit of all"" mandate makes this opportunity to serve two communities a good fit for Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS).",,,,,
"Unlocking the UAS Supply Chain, US Manufacturing Revitalization, and Rural UAS Use Cases",Discovery,,Very High,"THE PROBLEM 

A common need across government, the public, and industry is an accessible path to affordable, US-made unmanned aerial vehicle/unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology. This accessible path includes US-based manufacturing with reasonable procurement processes and prices, intellectual property (IP) ownership, and incentives for industry to take on innovation risks. Additionally, our research has shown that there is a need for autonomous systems to provide technology innovation for various applications. None of these needs-based concepts can move into implementation at scale because of supply chain and manufacturing issues. 

WHAT IF… 

NASA invests in creating a UAS Applications Innovation Consortium to revamp the relationship between small business and government as well as analyze the state of the US manufactured drone industry. This consortium will: 

Develop novel use cases that have the greatest potential for public good, focused on applications in rural America. 

Bring these use cases to teams at NASA with external collaborators to develop requirements and preliminary hardware designs for sustainably made (modular, repairable) UAS vehicles. 

Conduct a supply-chain gap analysis to identify what is currently missing in the US-based supply chain to build and implement the UAS public use-case designs.

A Future-proofed Aviation Workforce - Leapfrogging Workforce Shortages and Building Rural Resiliency with AR-VR,Discovery,,Very High,"Skilled worker shortages are forecast in all sectors of aviation, including pilots and maintenance/repair technicians. The use of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices and technologies are becoming standard equipment in many industries requiring trained workers to maintain and repair increasingly complex systems. Interviews with industry SMEs and our own online research indicate that pilot training is being modernized by the use of AR/VR in many of the larger aviation schools. This research also clearly identified a workforce and safety gap: certified UAS repair and maintenance technicians.  

The Connecting Rural Communities and Capabilities, (3C), sprint team explored how NASA might improve the lives and livelihoods of people in rural America. Workforce development, reskilling, and combatting “brain drain” as young people move from rural to urban centers were consistent challenges we heard in our research with rural stakeholders. Using AR/VR is an effective way to provide access to curriculum regardless of location and can bridge other access gaps for people with disabilities and other barriers such as distance or economic disadvantage. By leveraging trends identified in aviation workforce gaps as well as emerging technological capabilities, NASA is uniquely positioned to contribute to reducing this growing gap in workforce while simultaneously supporting economic resilience across America. 

The recent release of advanced AR/VR technologies (e.g. Apple’s Vision Pro, MS Hololens, and others) and development platforms indicates that hardware and software have reached a critical stabilizing moment: enduring capabilities with tailorable, modular, upgradable hardware and software.  

Promoting this area will also require collaboration with the FAA to develop and modernize the training requirements of UAS technicians as well as working with academia and industry to adopt this new technology on a broad basis and keep pace with innovation. Further collaboration with state and local economic development activities will help ensure equity across diverse populations and economic circumstances. 

Additionally, NASA’s own workforce could ultimately benefit from innovation in training. Dome simulators for pilots and astronauts cost $2-4K per hour compared to mere hundreds of dollars per hour with VR/AR according to Herbert Schilling who leads the Scientific Computing and Visualization Team and Graphics and Visualization (GVIS) Lab at Glenn Research Center. Further, faster training could solve huge turnover issues in rocket maintenance as they are —according to one NASA Stakeholder in the Space directorate—""hiring anyone they can find."" Current NASA AR/VR efforts have been oriented towards data visualization. By developing and applying AR/VR technology to UAS maintenance, NASA solves one of its own issues in maintaining a reliable fleet of UAS to support its various missions. This OCR’s continuation could elevate and validate AR/VR for critical tasks and workforce development.",,,,,

Climate change is the greatest threat to society. NASA and humanity should urgently generate solutions that maintain and improve quality of life while also not intensifying and if possible, mitigating existing causes of climate change.  The leading driver of climate change is human activity generating increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere. NASA has an opportunity to create self-powered carbon sequestration aerial solutions to offset Earth’s carbon levels. 
A carbon negative electric aircraft: 
Fuselage manufactured from ultra-light weight materials (i.e: carbon fiber)
High-voltage thin film perovskite solar arrays laminated onto the wings and fuselage in production. The integrated perovskite solar cells offset power density needs for high-power density batteries for electrified aircraft reducing weight. 
Perovskites solar cells also provide possibility for photoelectrochemical cells – the ideal solar driven method to convert CO2 into fuels.
The self-powered electric aircraft is sequestering CO2 during flight ? carbon negative. This can be applied to airships (blimps) deployed solely for climate maintenance.

QUiet Efficient ENgine: QUEEN,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Opportunity: 
Noise levels and characteristics of proposed electric propulsors prevent community acceptance and present a barrier to entry. 
DEP
Distinctive character of DEP acoustics is significantly more annoying and harmful: traditional noise metric analysis do not capture this critical effect and current “rule-of-thumb” design guidelines are invalid. It is vital to incorporate community and ecological noise expertise with quick turn-around testing very early in the aircraft design process – this is not the current practice. This paradigm shift will enable and accelerate DEP-equipped aircraft acceptance: enabling electrification of single aisle subsonic transports and expanding AAM market penetration while benefiting the community and protecting environment. 
Distributed Electrical Propulsion (DEP) is a leading candidate to achieve ARMD’s aggressive goal of zero emission aviation. As DEP is implemented and proliferates into areas currently not served or underserved by aviation – local (Advanced Air Mobility), regional (Regional Air Mobility), intraregional, urban –as well as future single aisle markets – the number of people adversely impacted by noise grows exponentially.

Icing Mitigation through Quantum Sensing,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"The primary focus of aircraft icing research has been on ice accretion on wings for its serious adverse consequences. When icing occurs on a wing, the change in airfoil shape results in a decrease in lift and an increase in drag, leading to potentially fatal accidents. Although the issue was recognized in the 1920s, the icing problem is still an area of ongoing research due to the complexity of the icing phenomena.
A much-improved understanding of how certain weather conditions produce different icing characteristics will lead to new mitigation methods and a better quantification of current methods. This can be done by better understanding of the molecular bonding energy produced by ice polytype combinations when interacting with different surface materials in various environments.

Digital Transformation for Multimodal Transportation R&D,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Digital Transformation for Multimodal Transportation R&D
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: We can apply digital and agile techniques to transform the way we conduct multi-modal aeronautics research, delivering better research results, faster, and at lower cost.  This transformation is enabled by practical application of data science, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  The primary barrier is organizational change-management, the most wicked of all problems. Achieving this change would reduce the risk that the nation fails to produce a safe, equitable, and globally competitive transportation system.
Opportunity:  NASA can help establish a national infrastructure for multimodal transportation science R&D. This will enable a new way of learning through innovative R&D workflows, resulting in dramatically improved outcomes in testing, producing, operating, and commercializing the coming wave of innovation. Success makes NASA research more effective and efficient, NASA tech transfers more impactful, and creates a change model for others to follow.
Partnership: Existing NASA partnerships and efforts with DOT, DoD, and FAA will be part of this this idea. NASA would serve the nation well by bringing this wildly ambitious concept into the national dialogue, planting a seed for future generations, and building partnerships all along the way.  
Deliverables: If selected, we will develop and deliver three essential ingredients for lasting organizational change: (1) a concept to transform workflows for researchers, project managers, and system engineers in the multimodal AAM space; (2) rigorous mathematical definitions and models that underpin the concept; (3) a working prototype of the digital engineering database and toolset.

" in-Situ WirelEss Power Transmission 
(SWEPT)",Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Opportunity:Sustainable power generation is crucial for the development and advancement of any country or community on Earth.  

Creating power-independence through Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) in locations where it is not practical to run power transmission lines, wind-farms or other traditional means of power could “close the gap” by supplying clean-energy across open distances or to remote locations where infrastructure and transportation are no longer viable.   
The concept of wireless transmission of electrical energy – is not new – from Tesla’s early concepts of free energy to NASA concepts of spaced-based solar farms supplying power down to Earth or to the surface of another world. The two technologies that appear most suitable for wireless power transmission  involve electromagnetic  energy (microwave/infrared).  Until recently, technology and interest had not advanced to the state where such applications could be possible.

Partnering with the emerging commercial technology providers (PowerLight Technologies, Emrod Energy, Electric Sky) can rapidly reduce the overall cost and schedule for this technology advancement.

Enabling Recyclable Aircraft,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Opportunity: Current aircraft are largely designed/manufactured/used without a plan to reclaim and re-use the materials after a single vehicle lifetime. Further, the materials and manufacturing processes used for aircraft can have a negative environmental impact. Natural resources, like metals and petroleum based resins, are limited and can be hard to extract.

Describe the problem NASA should be solving. 
There is a large opportunity for research and development by NASA to enable future recyclable aircraft, including:
Enabling expanded use for aircraft structures of existing materials that more readily enable re-use, such as thermoplastics
Advancements to allow larger use of biodegradable bio-based materials such as ‘green composites’ made of natural materials 
Adapting the design and analysis of structures for future aircraft to account for the durability and lifetime of these eco-friendly materials/approaches
Developing structural health monitoring with distributing sensing to detect current health state of future materials/structures in order to decrease failure risks that may exist with non-traditional aerospace materials (such as advanced eco-materials)
Develop prognostics solutions for eco-materials to predict vehicle lifetime and durability
Integrating 1-5 to enable data-informed decisions that can lead to optimal recyclable/eco aircraft structures

Bio-composites: Current research is already testing the use of green materials to make interior components like aircraft window/roof panels. 
Polymer composites: Fibers/resin not easily separated. Resins petroleum based. Current research is looking into how to recycle thermoplastics.

 Mars Airborne Explorer    ,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Vehicle and mission design for Meso-scale scientific access to southern highlands of Mars.
Planetary researchers at ARC, APL, GRC, JPL, Universities, Academies of Science 	Aeronautics research centers – AFRC, ARC, GRC, LRC 	Martian Mission Planners - JPL Many of the problems presented by trying to develop a vehicle for the southern highlands of mars require pushing the boundaries on aeronautics design, rf systems, and concepts of operations. As such it is a balance between relying on tried-and-true methods and techniques and pushing the technological envelope to obtain better performance than was necessary for terrestrial applications.   •	Low density atmosphere results in low Reynolds number combined with high Mach Effects. •	CO2 atmospheric properties are different than air and are more difficult to predict. •	Air-launched after entry from space presents unique challenges. •	Unfolding a vehicle in flight on Mars has not been sufficiently investigated. •	Communicating critical events during flight over 250,000,000 km distance has not been solved. •	Change in weight due to gravity but fixed inertia complicates vehicle design. •	Time delay for data to Earth requires in-flight autonomous decisions on data selection. •	Data path to Earth is severely limited requiring data return over weeks and months.
Mission proposals for Discovery class will happen in 2026 and 2028. Project would need to develop and test critical components and conops prior to submission for these proposal windows.
When we need to show a Technical Review that the individual technologies are at a TRL of 6 or better for a mission proposal in the Discovery class.
Advances in wing loading such as bell span loading allow for stable aircraft designs that do not require a tail, or indeed any vertical surfaces and do not require complicated controllers. Avionics and Flight Controllers as well as highly autonomous systems in very small packages allow for a realistic flight package to be purchased COTS which improves testing and use terrestrially. Improvements in science instruments such as Helium 4 Optically Pumped Magnetometers and Quantum State Magnetometers allow for precise measurements of weak magnetic fields to be obtained in small instruments. Advances in RF system design and modeling to allow for conformal antennas and digital beamforming to be incorporated into aircraft skin.

A possible solution to the problem involves using a fixed wing aircraft that has very low wing loading, which is the same problem that a very high-altitude aircraft has. The vehicle will need to be low drag and low weight with a large wing area. Technological improvements for this kind of aircraft have spin off effects for the aviation industry as a whole, which is attempting to vastly reduce carbon footprint by 2050. The technologies envisioned for this problem can be directly applied to improve other efforts within ARMD, such as SFD or SUSAN. Improving data link rates while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency is of interest for commercial and defense aerospace.
NASA has aeronautics and space capabilities and knowledge that can help with design, wind tunnels, CFD servers, and airborne assets that can help with testing and iterations of design, and commercial partnerships that can be leveraged to make possible high altitude testing to improve TRL. NASA AFRC has institutional knowledge for tailless aircraft design utilizing bell spanloads, a more efficient and stable design technique to improve structural efficiency.
Development of a platform that can enter from space and traverse in a low-density environment has similar applications in earth science and defense observations. Earth science can benefit as the platform is well suited for in-situ measurements across air masses at very high altitudes in the 90,000-120,000’ range. This is a regime that cannot be easily studied by weather balloon. These measurements would have a large effect on improving weather modeling and forecasts. A vehicle that can enter from space and fly at these altitudes may be useful for defense applications as this is above surface to air missile range. Conformal antenna design and beam forming improve data throughput and security of airborne transmissions. Power generation incorporated into composite structures allows for new electrically powered or augmented aircraft design.
Martian exploration is currently limited to soft landings. This method requires either large fuel expenditures (expensive), use of a parachute (requires the higher density of lower elevations on Mars) or a combination of the two. To date, no vehicles have successfully landed at altitudes above the Martian datum, which effectively removes more than 50% of the surface from access. To leverage a fixed wing aircraft, the vehicle will need to fly comfortably at an altitude of 115,000’ MSL on earth. However, even with that testing, there are aspects that cannot be matched through testing on Earth and will have to be modeled. The first time the vehicle flies in the Martian atmosphere will be the first time it flies with all the conditions at the same time..",,,,,
Autonomous Navigation ,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"Current navigation techniques are based on large infrastructure systems such a GPS, WAAS and RDF.  However, these systems do not exist on the Moon or Mars and on Earth are vulnerable to jamming due to conflict or natural events, such as solar storms.  The ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have demonstrated that regional GPS signals can be blocked (see the map provided below).  NASA’s recent Ingenuity helicopter demonstrated powered flight on Mars but could not leave the vicinity of its host, the Mars Perseverance Rover, because it had no regional navigation capability.  NASA’s Artemis program will be deploying rovers on the Moon in the next decade, without a planetary scale GPS network in place. What is needed is improved autonomous navigation capabilities which could allow aircraft and surface vehicles to navigate without any external infrastructure dependencies.
The stakeholders are planetary scientists and NASA mission planners such as the Ingenuity autonomous NASA helicopter that operated on Mars from 2021 to 2024 as part of the Mars 2020 mission.  In addition, commercial aviation and the US Air Force, which has recently been affected by Russian GPS spoofing in Europe and the Middle East. The development of new navigation systems can endanger human life.  Such a system will need to be developed in coordination with the FAA and DOT.
For terrestrial civilian and military applications, the problem is current.  GPS is currently being jammed in the war zones of Ukraine and the Middle East. For NASA the problem will become current in the late 2020s when the Mars Sample Return mission will deploy multiple helicopters to the surface of Mars.  NASA will also need these capabilities in the early 2030s when the Artemis program will start sending astronauts and rovers to the moon. 
It already is for terrestrial applications and will in the late 2020s for NASA.
Continue conflict in the Middle East and Europe and NASA’s plans to explore the Moon and Mars.
Improved regional autonomous navigation systems.
Blocking of GPS directly affects aviation safety.
Yes, there are extensive capabilities at many NASA Centers. For example, the Ames Flight Dynamics team and synthetic biology and bioengineering groups; the National Space-Based Positioning; Navigation and Timing Executive Committee (EXCOM); NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program; the Global Differential GPS (GDGPS); Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS); and JSC Guidance, Navigation & Control Subsystems .
Safer air travel and safer planetary exploration.
There are many organizations and companies interested in working in this space.  NASA should establish a consortium to bring these entities together to ensure coordination and that solutions meet NASA, FAA and DOT standards while protecting individual intellectual property rights.",,,,,
Collaborative Hydrogen Testing Area  ,Wicked Wild,,Very High,"There is a large and increasing need for hydrogen test capabilities for the development of components, subsystems, and systems for aircraft and other transportation systems. Industry is showing a desire to develop systems for clean energy solutions, but testing with hydrogen, and especially liquid hydrogen is challenging and costly. Furthermore, there is a need to explore the trade-space around operational aircraft refueling.  There may be synergistic ways to combine the two problems.
NASA, DOE, FAA, DOT, US Industry around the country that are developing or qualifying liquid hydrogen technologies. Large portions of government involvement are driven to help enable US Industry to achieve decarbonization goals.Costs of implementations / changes to infrastructure Hydrogen safety / public perception around hydrogen safety Achieving consensus among stakeholders on a viable and integrated development approach.
Years to 10s of years
Within the next 5 years if there are insufficient testing facilities developed, hydrogen will likely self-select out as a solution.
Currently, the development of hydrogen fueled transportation systems, both for DOT and DOE as ground transportation (medium to heavy duty trucks, trains) are driving development in the hydrogen transportation space.  The capabilities necessary for hydrogen-fueled aircraft will be different largely because of increased sensitivity to weight. 
The ability to procure, store, distribute (within a facility/site), and dispose of/recover liquid hydrogen, as well as control temperature and pressure, adapt to various test article sizes and configurations, and safely perform LH2 testing are needed for the energy and transportation infrastructure.
The components that need testing would be directly applicable to aircraft and also go within the airport infrastructure for handling cryogenic fuel and loading it onto aircraft.
Yes, NASA has extensive expertise in cryogenic system testing as well as multiple test facilities and capabilities that could be leveraged that are currently not being fully utilized. Additional investments could enable enhanced capabilities in existing facilities and the development of new capabilities better suited to a specific application. These resources are mainly at GRC, WSTF, and to a lesser extent at a few other centers. Potential partners include the DOE, FAA, Hydrogen Distribution Companies (Linde, Air Liquide, etc)
Technologies get stuck in the valley of death and can’t quickly mature for implementation or are matured/implemented in an unsafe manner that puts undue and uninformed members of the public at risk.
Implementation of test facilities are expensive due to the complexities of handling liquid hydrogen and safety requirements. Additionally, the general level of experience handling liquid hydrogen within US Industry is low. This is a problem across multiple industries that is being experienced by multiple government agencies as the hydrogen infrastructure and research capital in the US grows.  Use of NASA facilities and expertise to supplement US Industry allows the nation to claim full use of the investments that it has made through NASA over the past 60+ years.",,,,,

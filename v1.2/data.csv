How might we harvest energy and shield against radiation with melanin?,Wicked Wild,Medium,"Commercial aircraft use about 100 MW of electricity. All that electricity must be generated by the aircraft. This require converting fuel to electricity that results in a reduction of aircraft efficiency. If some portion of that energy could be harvested without the expenditure of fuel that would increase aircraft efficiency. Aircraft operate at high altitudes where UV radiation and cosmic radiation levels are much greater than at ground level. This radiation represents a source of energy that remains unharvested. This free energy could be used to increase the energy efficiency of aircraft while reducing passenger exposure to harmful radiationMelanin is known mostly as a pigment but is a multifunctional material that accels at adsorbing UV and cosmic radiation that make it ideal for energy harvesting applications.  Melanin panels could harvest energy to supplement power. ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:Investigate the ability of natural and synthetic melanin’s to adsorb energy and produce electricity  for aerospace applications.","bioinspired melanin based energy harvesting pitch. The basic premise behind this proposal is that commercial aircraft are huge consumers of electricity and every single water that electricity has to be generated by the aircraft itself.
And we know that, you know, whenever we take something like jet fuel and convert it to some other form of energy, like electricity, it's not perfect. There it's, you know, there are losses involved and that comes at the expense of efficiency to the aircraft.
So is there, you know, some way where we could possibly augment or supplement the energy that is around the aircraft and possibly generate some electricity to help these aircraft become more fuel efficient? Now, one of the things is is that because commercial aircraft, you know, they typically fly at very high altitudes and in clear Sky early because they're they're up above the clouds.
The UV radiation at altitude is about 100% greater than what we experience here at ground level.
And cosmic radiation is continuously bombarding earth with about 1 giga electron volts or with energies of about 1 gig electron volts at the rate of about 10,000 per square meter every 2nd. And this happens day and night. So even aircraft flying night time routes or even in cloud clouds, you know, and it's not reliant strictly on on solar energy, but in cosmic energy is is Sir no. So if some portion of that energy, which right now just hits an aircraft and and goes unused, it some part of that could be harvested and converted into electrical energy that could be put back into the aircraft, that would help aircraft. Ohh efficiency. And so you know, how could that be accomplished? Well, you know, the whole idea of energy harvesting isn't new. You know, we have plenty of examples of that currently on Earth, you know, from hydroelectric dams, wind farm, solar farms. All of those take existing energy and harvest it and convert it into electrical energy. One of the things that is our our materials that has been under the radar but is extremely common is melanin. 
Melanin is simply known, or or mostly known, just as a dark brown or a black pigment, and you know helps give us our skin color and and protect us from sunburn. However, that's not really doing melon and much justice. It really is a biopolymer that is amazingly multifunctional. Uh, and it's a macromolecular material, which is a mouthful to say that excels at transforming uh energy, particularly energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, from an A broad portion of that, all the way from like, near infrared to real short wavelength energy like UV and cosmic energy into electricity. Well and and it and it does it through a two stage process. First, it converts it uh into heat, which is exactly why when we go out into the sunlight and and sunlight feels warm, the melanin in our skin is immediately absorbing that energy, converting it to heat, and then it eventually converts it to electricity. So the idea of this is that melanin it's ideally suited for energy harvesting applications, so if we could, you know, and as I show in a in the PowerPoint here, you know if we could coat the top surface or or part of a fuselage with basically melanin based energy harvesting panels and and convert that energy that impacts on those surfaces kind of like a solar cell for an airplane or a type of thing, then it could go into the electrical system of the aircraft and basically you know we know that you know in commercial aircraft you.
Know cost of operation and efficiency you know is is tremendous and so. You know the operators of commercial aircraft are looking for, you know, even fractional increases in efficiency.

","the context for today's presentation is that AI ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AIML systems remain very attractive targets for these kind of adversarial attacks. So industry has kind of been looking at this and we I put here some examples where an IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications. And similarly, a 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft and adversarial examples.
So the key idea here is that AI ML systems are vulnerable to these adversarial attacks across the entire life cycle of development, deployment and inference. So you know, the idea here is that there's this intersection of AI, ML, and cryptography, and there's many different kind of business sectors that live at this intersection.
And we can kind of leverage some of these enabling technologies from cryptography such as public key encryption, data signature, zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption. And there's all these other ones as well. And so the idea is that leveraging these kind of cryptographic primitives would enable us to build trust in systems and enforce good behavior as opposed to relying on trusting some entity or company or third party. So characteristics that build trust in these systems are that AI Mel systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy.
And that's a big key. Their privacy and that, you know, the idea here is that development of verifiable AIML standards and regulations that rely on these cryptographic guarantees can replace trusting companies.
So some simple examples just to give some intuition behind the ideas here is that you know, everybody's probably used open AI's chat GPT. So when you send a request to chat GPT, how do you know that the answer you get back is from the correct model?
So say that you're a subscriber to their premium service. You pay $10.00 a month to get access to chat GPT 4 when open AI returns their response. How do you know that they're running inference on chat GPT 4 as opposed to a cheaper model that might be more kind of profitable from a business perspective? Well, the answer is that you don't know you are putting trust in open AI to do the right thing. So some the examples here of different use cases are one that I just talked about here was the 2nd bullet, which is proof of inference. So the idea there is that, you know, you can leverage some of these cryptographic tools to validate or verify that you ran inference on the correct model. Some other use cases are, you know, let's say a company says, hey, I have some machine learning model, it was this accurate. How do you how do you verify that their performance on some data set is what they claim, while in both those situations you can use these cryptographic tools called 0 knowledge proofs?
There's other tools that you can use, such as fully homomorphic encryption, that enable privacy preserving mill so you can do the idea there is you can encrypt data, send to a large data center, do compute on your encrypted data and get back the answer that you had to begin with. And then now there's some other ideas about kind of by hardware attestation and provenance to ensure integrity of data that are running through your pipelines.

How might we improve airborne communication with Vortex Beam Communication for Interference Mitigation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity:
Desirability: We are addressing the spectrum scarcity problem in the context of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).
Viability: Our solution makes use of a spatial filtering technique, which we are currently demonstrating in the laboratory under an existing NASA project aimed at low Earth orbit (LEO) to terrestrial communication.
Feasibility: Adoption of our method will require some changes to communication infrastructure; however, the ability to communicate in the presence of in-band interference could change the paradigm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication standards.
Key Use Cases: Any case involving line-of-sight communication links that cannot take advantage of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, which rely on multipath propagation.

“Wicked-Wild” Idea:
Exploit the orthogonality of vortex beams to allow for simultaneous usage of specific portions of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
Isolate data channels using spatial-domain filtering techniques as opposed totraditional frequency-filtering techniques.
Increase data transfer volume by using multiple vortex beams of the same carrier frequency.
","thank you so advanced air mobility or ATM is the future of air transportation that explores the development of new technologies to revolutionize airspace usage and is a rapidly developing field that will include low altitude passenger transport, cargo delivery and public service capabilities. However, because the radio spectrum is a limited resource to increase of aircraft in the air, space raises concerns about potential interference with aviation communication.
This increased disruption of critical communication and navigation signals can be caused by a variety of factors, both internal and external, to aviation systems.
In severe cases, radiofrequency or RF interference caused by unintentional emissions or deliberate jamming can lead to important safety risks.
Here is how vortex beam communication stands as a promising solution to interference mitigation in the context of AM are are at vortex harnesses, an underutilized property of radio waves.
Their orbital angular momentum or OEM, the angular momentum of an of an electromagnetic or yam wave is composed of two parts, spin angular momentum corresponding to depolarization of the emwave and orbital angular momentum OAM associated to the spatial distribution of the EM wave. This integer value defines the number of helical terms the wavefront makes around the propagation axis.
By tailoring the antenna ray to generate a desired oil mode, say plus one, we can transmit a targeted beam.
Only receiver is equipped to detect the plus one mode will be able to decode the information.
Now visualized data traveling on an invisible highway for each lane is defined by distinct helical twist in the signal itself.
This twist, characterized by the OEM, forms the foundation for a powerful technique known as spatial multiplexing, which allows for the transmission of multiple independent data streams on the same frequency.
By utilizing the spatial domain, we overcome interference limitations inherent to current RF systems.
The orthogonality of OAM modes unlocks a dramatic increase in data capacity for applications previously limited by bandwidth constraints.
But beyond share capacity Re Vortex offers unique addressing capabilities.
Each OEM mode has a specific topological charge acting as its unique identifier or fingerprint.
Imagine beams with charges, for example plus one and -2.

In crowded environments with many RF signals.
OEM filtering allows receivers to focus on their specific OEM fingerprint, ignoring irrelevant signals and thus reducing interference while enabling targeted information delivery with high signal to noise ratio and accuracy.
Overall, encoding data on OEM modes consists of an information signal modulating the electric field of the RF wave.
By carefully manipulating the phase distribution across the wavefront, thus creating specific OEM modes carrying the encoded data, the then multiple OEM modes carrying different data streams can be superimposed and transmitted together.
Specialized antenna arrays at the receiving end can then separate these modes based on their unique face patterns, all of which makes this vortex beam communication technology hold the key to reshaping the way the data is transferred and interference mitigated in a soon to be crowded airspace.",,,"Enabling trust in AI/ML applications and development.

How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation.

Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.

This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.

"Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST)
",Wicked Wild,High,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science/engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.
What if…we could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by
 improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety, and efficiency using lightweight polymer aerogels
Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage
Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy
","So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten.
It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks.
So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport.
This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.

Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95% large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly.
You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft.",,"Problem Title: Safely, compactly, and economically storing H2 as an aviation fuel.

","I'm talking about heat generation. That's inherent to any process, and specifically in this context, the excess heat generated throughout an aircraft as NASA and countries around the globe look to sustainable aviation to address greener climate and environmental initiatives, we can also shift our perspective on heat generated by engines, batteries and other aircraft components from being a detriment or a flaw to the generated heat being designed feature. Here we have an opportunity to employ energy harvesting as part of an integrated multifunctional system to support our electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation, as well as moving a few degrees closer to closing the loop on sustainability. With that, we can address the desirability, viability and feasibility of taking on this opportunity.

Optical Fiber for electric-vehicle temperature sensing
Completely Optical – Won’t cause or affected by EMI
High Spatial Density – multiple sensors cascaded onto one fiber for FEM level temperature gradient monitoring","Today I want to propose the idea of using optical fiber for temperature sensing for electric 5 vehicles. Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle.
Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e.
Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation.
Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen.
You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical.
It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal.
Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery.
You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire.
Now you have you you have a temperature distribution every half inch interval across your your airplane.",,,"Airbridge to Nationwide Quantum Connectivity.

We NASA aeronautics could potentially use it for secure app security applications and also for perhaps doing improved CFDS CFD calculations so it can be an economic game changer. And so it's something that that the nation is fully, you know, invested in and trying to develop this technology.

People are going to want to get access to it. They're going to want to have the ability to do things that are new and just haven't been possible before.

1. The work will build upon the dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept first demonstrated
in 1956 to enable a path to low emissions, which reduced demands on renewable energy and
infrastructure, towards zero emissions. The dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept retains the
wing tanks and economically adds hydrogen to a 737-class single aisle offloading Jet A to retain
the same range enabling flexible aircraft operations and paths forward. Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel
aircraft with only 2080km of zero emission range, or 30% hydrogen by energy can reduce
emissions by 50% can be raised to an astonishing 97.5% at lower and more stable fuel costs
than SAF and Jet A. The low energy per unit volume of hydrogen introduces significant aviation
challenges for 100% LH2 fueled aircraft to economically meet the stringent mass, volume, and
safety requirements and the first order optimum is ~30% LH2 by energy. The 97.5% U.S.
emissions reduction will require a change in the airline business model.
The dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept is a significant departure from the 2021 U.S. Aviation
Climate Action Plan based on drop-in carbon-based Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and most
importantly, is not a ‘farther term technology” that also retains the current Aero portfolio to
offset increases in cost. The U.S. Climate Action Plan stated that there was no expectation that
LH2 aircraft would make a significant contribution towards achieving net-zero emissions by
2050. The much slower adoption of hydrogen fuel was also based primarily upon the need to
access renewable energy and to develop ground storage and distribution systems, and to a
lesser extent, upon the need mature electric and hydrogen technologies and to tackle several
other technical and safety challenges. The 2020 European Hydrogen Aircraft study cited a
derived need for ~4300GW for 100% SAF vs 1450 GW for 100% LH2--likely overlooked--while
30% LH2 would require 435 GW, a ten-fold decrease, but must add back liquefaction energy. By
relying on off-grid and excess energy, LH2 production will not have to rely on grid provided
renewable energy. Note that plant based SAF may only achieve 25% carbon emission
reduction, ~4X less than carbon free hydrogen and SAF via direct air capture.
At present, 2050 SAF goals are unstainable beyond ‘not achieving the net-zero by 2050
goal’. In general, limited supply SAF (HEFA) is the lowest cost while unbounded supply based on
direct air capture [a massive green prize] plus green LH2 (PtL/e-kerosene) is the highest cost
fuel. SAF’s have predicted costs 2-10x the cost of Jet A, creating a significant risk to national
and world security, in an attempt to limit aircraft and infrastructure modifications, besides
incorrectly assuming SAF would require less renewable energy and that off-grid, excess
renewable energy is not available, which would favor hydrogen.
The U.S. Climate Action Plan correctly identified that Aviation *must change the fuel* to
meet net zero goals and that technology alone showcased in the in EPFD and TTBW/X-66A
demonstrators would *not* be sufficient. In *contrast*, hydrogen aircraft would become the
pull technology in fewer higher energy locations to help eliminate grid bottlenecks and reduce
emissions in the hard to decarbonize industries. In contrast, rather than remove fuselage and
engines from a MD-90 to form the TTBW/X66A, adding hydrogen tanks could fly the same
number of PAX with hydrogen plumbed to the rear-mounted engines. The Airbus A380 LH2
demonstrator adds a 3rd hydrogen engine cantilevered from the fuselage along with the
hydrogen fuel system and tank. In contrast, while the truss braced wing is an excellent design
for battery and 100% hydrogen aircraft since ~no energy will be carried in the wings, the lower
amount of jet fuel carried must be further considered in a dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept.
In the proposed work, hydrogen must be approached from a systems level, because it
won’t work unless you have all the pieces to make it work from an operating system. Since
hydrogen production results from off-grid and/or excess renewable energy, dual fuel does not
have to be dependent on grid green energy and wait 30 years. Conversely, objectives are
achieved when a bottoms-up understanding of the assumptions, physics, and resources
including those outside NASA’s domain are tracked, compared, and traded versus
vehicle/system goals requiring proper communication/insight, including what happens when
projects are not priorities or technology risks are not properly identified, and subsystems are
not compatible. Safety cannot be assessed without integrated designs and hardware. Indeed,
many others recognize one must limit the need for renewable energy and potential
infrastructure buildup and dual fuel enables aircraft flexibility across the globe while
significantly reducing emissions economically. UH: “Boeing and Airbus are likely to develop a
replacement for these venerable models (single aisles dominated by the B737 and A320) for
entry into service in the mid-2030s. The only way aviation can meet Paris Agreement emissions
targets is if the new single aisle airplanes are hydrogen powered.” “A hydrogen single aisle
does not need to be a radical new design” an unstretched MD-90 or a ‘Transatlantic Concept’
flying the same number of PAX as a A320 needs to be examined, as well as adding the
unducted fan/ultra-high-bypass engine, to name but a few paths to explore.
A 100% hydrogen powered aircraft increases fuel volume over four-fold versus a
conventional aircraft occupying cargo and passenger space, while 30% hydrogen by energy can
provide 50 to 97.5% reduction in emissions via 2080km of zero emissions range to tackle the
easy part of the range sooner and more economically with 9 times less energy than ekerosine/Power-to-Liquid (plus liquefaction energy) at 2 to 10 times less cost than SAF.
The dual fuel concept--ready for short term demonstrations as there are no insurmountable
problems--opens up the design space for further out technologies including those beyond NASA
and all of the areas identified in this Green Aviation New work: Alternative Propulsion, Aircraft
Design, Materials and Manufacturing, Air Traffic Management, Emission Control, Sustainable
Infrastructure, and Contrail Formation requiring $100Ms not $M.
Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel aircraft with 14% hydrogen by weight can reduce emissions safely
by 50 to 97.5% to supplement SAF reductions at less costs, and more importantly, will reduce
demands on renewable energy and infrastructure. The work will perform studies of the dual 
hydrogen-jet fuel concepts and many key components, describe key SAF challenges and
limitations, outline the pathways, challenges, and infrastructure changes for dual fuel aircraft
and technologies to speed the transition safely and economically to beyond net zero.
2. The work will further examine the strengths and weaknesses of the dual fuel concept to
reduce emissions by 50% sooner and more economically than SAF within the time frame of the
award and resources provided. Benefits and opportunities for dual hydrogen-jet fuel electric
propulsion will be described. The milestone is to provide sufficient justification that leads to a
demonstration path or to be unlikely usurped by alternative approaches. Many innovative
design details and the 97.5% justification are not described due to proposal limits but will be
further developed as bottoms up design is required for system assessments, to address safety.
3. The limited resource Green Aviation New Work is only a path to zero emissions which
will require $Bs to place aircraft into service, identify the limitations and hence opportunities
for further R&D in an expanded design space that transcends NASA—a significant effort beyond
the PI abilities to raise the TRL. Before this work is completed, NASA could outsource the same
work to a University Led Initiative, add a task to the Truss Braced Wing Demonstrator, have
another organization help develop a key technology( e.g., tanks), or collaborate further with
other agencies to develop the infrastructure, to name just a few.
4. If the concepts are not technically feasible, it then creates the opportunity to examine
or ignore alternatives and/or breakdown current approach to the key challenges likely
presenting opportunities to other disciplines. Proposal constraints prevents addressing many
detailed design issues. Innovation occurs when folks presented with a problem ask, ‘how may
we look at this differently’. How one pivots depends on many factors, but especially on how
complete the current approach was examined. With so many areas to investigate listed above,
it will require a re-examination of the path forward to first expand and then contract the trade
space with data. Another factor is that SMEs are not always correct, and often do not present
limitations clearly, so it’s important to understand the rationale for this assessment, especially
if new data/methods and/or a breakthrough overcomes the limitation.
In the case of dual fuel, the most obvious alternative approach is SAF via DAC that becomes
sustainable or funded by DOD for National Security, which is only a small fraction of NASA
domain, so this is a limited opportunity. A logical pivot would be toward technology to reduce
fuel burn to reduce resources required for zero emissions. The pivot would have to make an
impact since there are no rewards for failure in a very mature and challenging industry since
the story being told in general is that one shifts to line or project management. Further
developing AI, propulsion, electrical, materials, and other discipline and technology skills almost
always help develop paths forward so will also be included in the pivot options-perhaps better
than let the team understand that path forward is unlikely.""",,,,

How might we democratize the Medical Supply chain through aviation? 
How might we regulate drones/democratized aviation in the future medical supply chain? 
Why is this a problem? 
The use of drones, or unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics has a range of potential strengths: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. However, large numbers of drones may affect other aircraft operating in the same local airspace, the infrastructure for the introduction of a significant number of drone systems does not exist, and there are significant number of regulatory and safety issues involved. Lack of technical expertise within regulating bodies on these subjects. And, there are a couple of real technological barriers that are wicked hard and nobody has tackled them [REF - The Big Case for Small UAS Access to the National Airspace System.pdf (sharepoint.com)]. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
UTM (Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management) system is being developed by NASA and FAA to safely and efficiently integrate drone operations into the national airspace system where other vehicles also fly. Increasing the capability of individual drones towards more complete on-board situational awareness to avoid safety hazards or impact to the airspace can shift the problem from one of centralized management to one of self-managed systems that do not require human intervention. SBIR (GH). 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
More advanced management capabilities of the air space will allow improved safety and efficiency. Technology development of drone and vehicle artificial intelligence, autonomy, internal/external vehicle situational awareness can impact drone capabilities on an individual level. Overall, the introduction of drones into the air space will change the nature of the airspace and begin the early phase of addressing these individual drone operational challenges

"How might the entire aviation experience be restructured to reduce its risk as a vector of pathogen transmission? (reducing unnecessary contact, etc.)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Why is this a problem? 
The drive to reduce human interaction in aviation has at least 2 influencing factors: The attempt to safeguard public health from the spread of contagions; and an economic drive towards automation to decrease staffing and expense associated with airline and the airport employees. However, this can lead to the depersonalization of air travel and, depending on the efficiency of the automation, potential inefficiencies in handling customer complaints/problems as well as removing a public face representing and individual airline company.

If the aviation industry is a major vector for pathogen transmission, it will continue to generate global pandemics as strict border control will be more porous than otherwise. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?
At the very least, the interactions of automated system should be at least as efficient as human based customer service. This implies improved artificial intelligence be implemented so that either unexpected events can be addressed or quickly re-routed to human staffing.
Additional interfaces need to be designed to be pathogen resistant in case cleaning is less effective or skipped.
Standard, practiced changes to routing and operations if pathogens are detected or a higher risk of transmission.
Additional changes to cabin design to mitigate risk.
Airport redesign to reduce transmission while waiting in line, etc.

(Worker to Passenger vectors) Automated check-in and self-serve kiosks have already become a standard aspect of flight service. This drive to minimize staffing and increase automation in customer service is already happening across multiple industries. Increasing automation and autonomous systems may result in airports in which the process is fully automated and one does not have to interact with a member of the airline or airport staff in order to board the plane.

Wickedness? CAS-worthy?
This may be a technological progression that will first be implemented in the range of other industries before it reaches aviation. This may not be CAS-worthy problem because the market is already addressing automation (for costs).
But from the pathogen side and from the in-the-tube spread, automation doesn’t account for all interactions and may not even shield people from the most common mechanisms of pathogen transmission (because we don’t know what they are). From that perspective, CAS may have an valid entry point. There may be aircraft design and technology investments specific to the aircraft that may be worthwhile IF the pathogen transmissions is validated as a big problem. (See Capabilities list).

Why is this a problem? 
Large portions of the US population, particularly those with the greatest health challenges, do not participate in clinical research studies and thus do not benefit from those discoveries. Low accrual issues overall are the cause of 55% of terminated clinical trials. This lack of representation compromises generalizability, hinders innovation, impacts trust in the medical system, and compounds health disparities of communities without access. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Often, clinical trials are centered around academic or research institutions limiting participation by a broader sampling of the population. Capabilities to address this problem revolve around improving the ability for patients to participate, or, effectively, bringing the clinical trial to the patients. 
For example, travel impacts out-of-pocket costs to patients, typically driving remote patients out of studies. Distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established as a cause of lack participation by rural communities. 
Thus, one capability to improve participation would be to increase the accessibility to transportation in rural communities. 
Further, telemedicine and virtual or localized trial treatments may broaden the geographic diversity. 
While some aspects of this transformation are more related to overall trends in health care technology, the ability to provide well equipped mobile airborne laboratories could impact the ability to increase participation in clinical trials in rural communities. 
Beyond issues related to location, there is in general a lack of participation by racial and ethnic minority populations for a variety of socio-economic reasons. Specific outreach may be required to these populations, so investment in greater capabilities in community coordination. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation to allow more democratized transportation and the ability to bring more comprehensive health care capabilities, including clinical trial participation, no I don’t to remote regions; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. 
The trend in cost of flying will dictate further difficulties in equity. Cost has decreased over multiple decades, but may be stabilizing now (need to confirm).

US Participation was 28% of the total representation in global Clinical trials in 2015. The problem in the US is also then a global representation problem. With personalized genetic mods, medicine, this will become worse. With Climate change, disease and medical impacts will also worsen in the most distressed areas and populations (not currently studied). Specific rural communities are impacted by this problem already within the US. For example, distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations who are more likely to live far away from research centers. 
Academic centers conduct 55% of the NIH extramural research and operate 98% of the cancer centers. Participation in these activities is biased by the proximity to these centers. However, more broadly, effective clinical trials as a method for improved treatment and drug development has an impact on the population as a whole. Limiting the effectiveness of these trials because of a lack of participation by significant population subgroups narrows the trial’s impact and reduces benefits to society beyond the immediate drug and research.

Problem Scoping: 
Two divergent Healthcare Scenarios: 
Medical treatments become cost-effective enough to move to or stay in local hospitals, lessening the need for travel. 
Medical treatments become less cost-effective (or some do) to the point that treatment centers consolidate and are farther away from patients on average. This is the more likely scenario given the trends in health-apps, investing, travel nurses, minute-clinics, hospital funding problems. 
Given scenario (2), there are two Aviation Scenarios: 
Personal Air mobility or commercial aviation drops in cost sufficiently to counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Medical treatment (tools/supplies) become small enough and cheap enough to ship TO the patient, possibly by air (air hospital?) and counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Sub Problems: 
Does the shift to outpatient clinics reduce the availability of hospitals offering complex procedures and put greater need on air travel for the critically ill? 
Population is more distributed (remote work), so will more people be farther away from centralized services that cannot be financially solvent in closer facilities? 
Will the advancement or cost-efficiency of treatments drop enough to distribute healthcare to local clinics? 
Why is this a problem? 
As medical health care technology becomes more advanced, the cost of health care more expensive, and population more widely distributed, aviation may have an increasing effect on the accessibility of health care. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Aviation can provide services in the future that are presently either centralized or provided by a range of other transportation. The challenge will be to right-size and optimize the aviation capability to the needs of the health care problem. 
Transportation of medicine via UAVs with appropriate temperature/atmosphere/humidity control which can provide timely delivery, 
Airborne ambulances that can transport while providing care. 
Transportation of medical equipment to remote areas (on a rotation? As part of a pre-planned schedule?). 
Miniaturization of health tech 
More temp-stable medical goods that can survive rougher transport. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation ranging from the advent of personalized air vehicles to package delivery UAVs allowing a series of options for both human and package delivery; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. These trends are counterbalanced by ever increasing healthcare costs that may limit patient access. 
Telehealth – making people more comfortable with remote healthcare 
Robotic Telehealth – letting doctors stay where they are but keep robots local for surgery, etc. 
Cheaper diagnostics - reducing the need for travel to find out if you have a problem, reserving travel to treatment.’ 
Medical Tourism – will the cost and accessibility of medical tourism counterbalance the need for rural access. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
This is ANOTHER way that discrepancies between rural vs urban healthcare is mitigated by aviation. We scoped this to 100M because we believe that smaller procedures will become more accessible/local, but not ALL procedures. So globally, we believe that 100M people will be impacted or make decisions about treatment and safety based on access and cost. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? 
Score: 4-5 Majority 4 (given the costs and advanced nature of the treatments), but small percentage will be 5s, where care is absolutely critical to immediate survival. 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
We are assuming that the geographic consolidation of healthcare continues to the point that access is reduced. If that trend continues, we are confident aviation will be a greater player in access. If not, the question is moot. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy? 
It is suggested that this is a CAS-worthy problem. It is Wicked covering technical, political, societal, economic, and legal issues. It directly involves aerospace across the spectrum of vehicles. The range of technical challenges related to this topic are formidable spanning the range of NASA technologies. Other players in the market may influence parts of the system, but no one technology or solution can mitigate the entire issue of rural access. ",,,,,,,,,

How will aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to increased usage of antimicrobials in response to COVID-19? (airport safety protocols, and aircraft design)

Drug resistant bacteria is propagated by the use of heavy metals (lead, mercury, and silver) because of mining and transportation usage. Bacteria have evolved to resist the presence of these heavy metals, producing traits that also shield them from antibiotics. 
Normally heavy metals are lethal to bacteria because of the free emission of ions that disrupt cell functions.

Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. 
Lack of clean water and sanitation and inadequate infection prevention and control promotes the spread of microbes, some of which can be resistant to antimicrobial treatment.

There are a lot of different stakeholders that handle the cargo and each individual link in the chain needs to be up to standard, otherwise the whole quality of the supply chain can be lost.

But despite an increasing demand for transporting medicine worldwide, the sector has been falling behind other modes of transportation such as shipping or road, due to a lack of compliance, standardization, accountability and transparency across the supply chain. The air cargo share of global pharma products transport has declined from 17% in 2000 to 11% in 2013, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) notes. 
The reason behind the decline is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
Over 50% of all temperature excursions occur while products are in the hands of airlines and airports, according to IATA, which renders the products worthless or even dangerous for patients. 
However, according to the Seabury Group, just 0.5 million tonnes of pharmaceutical products are transported by air every year, compared to 3.5 million tonnes by sea. 
Annual product losses associated with these problems range from $2.5-$12.5bn, a figure that IATA describes as “unacceptably high in a $300 billion a year market”.** _ 
The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50% of vaccines are wasted globally every year; a large part because of lack of temperature control and the logistics to support an unbroken cold-chain. 
At the scale of COVID-19, this spoilage rate could waste potentially a billion vaccines, which, even if valued at a non-profit cost of around $10 a vaccine, represents a staggering wasted investment. 
Cracking the cold chain challenge is key to making vaccines ubiquitous (theconversation.com) 
The vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, is often used as the key metric for global vaccination coverage because it is a good indicator for access to routine immunization services. 13.5 million children were not vaccinated in 2018. 
out of 135 million under-one-year-olds more than 19 million did not receive full immunization

"How might medical ethics (Bodily Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice) conflict with aviation/transportation autonomy, distributed monitoring and services?",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Rewording Option: 
Something like: How will medical ethics need to change/adapt/evolve (if needed) in order for (medical related?) services such as autonomous aerial transport, distributed monitoring (over area, inside vehicle) to be accepted and deployed? 
Will current medical ethics (if remain unchanged) help or hinder the development/adoption of medical related aviation services such as autonomous transport (of goods or patients), and healthcare delivery and monitoring? 
Sub Problems: 
How does autonomy impact healthcare? How does autonomy of an aviation-based transport conflict with medical ethics? 
How will medical ethics interface with advancements in aviation (PAM, AAM, distributed monitoring/services, autonomous drones, etc?) 
Why is this a problem? 
This is a subset of a broader set of problems associated with the introduction of new technology and it’s impact on patient health. This scenario is different from conventional usage of air transportation that traditionally involves significant human in the loop interactions. Rather, to the extent that autonomous and automated systems become an aspect of health care, a new set of medical ethics concerns arise. Patient monitoring is necessary during medical transport. If this involves an autonomous or automated transportation system, then That patient information resides with in that autonomous or automated system and it needs to be handled appropriately. Timely delivery of supplies and services by whatever means is a core foundation of health care.

What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
There are two aspects of this problem. The first is technical regarding the capability of an autonomous or automated system the carry out its function in an optimized fashion minimizing impact to patient health. The second is the framework of legal and societal restrictions that impose upon the autonomous or automated system a layer of functionality that, for example, ensures confidentiality of patient information or appropriate response in emergency condition. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
One trend is that health care on a local level is becoming increasingly more distributed and advanced. The complexity of health care provided by, for example, emergency air evacuation services has increased over the years. The overall trend is that more can be done locally rather than in a centralized hospital setting. A second trend is changes in the air transportation system is envisioned over time to allow new forms of both personal air transport_ as well as also delivery of supply and materials. A third trend is the advancement of artificial intelligence and data handling systems that may be able to not only allow new types of vehicle operations, but also an ability to handle information in a more complex and situationally appropriate manner. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?. 
The overall impact varies depending on the type of transport. Related to emergency transport and care, the population may be limited and more concentrated in rural areas. However other forms of medical transport are much more common. For example, professional transport a patient from one health care facility to another is a relatively common occurrence within parameters dictated by legal and health insurance regulations. Further, if air transportation and medical supplies using, for example, autonomous or automated drones becomes a common occurrence, then the impact on the overall health care system on the performance of these technologies can be significant and broad based.

What is the problem or need?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances generate an environment of ubiquitous monitoring both on a personal and societal level. 
Personal health monitoring: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level. Privacy concerns arise related to use of personal information
Wearables hacking - how can we trust the data and protect the users?
There are also remote medical sensing technologies that could be as ubiquitous as CCTV, and even drone-mounted.
NASA's Aeronautics technologies can enable persistent, wide-area coverage of climate-related parameters and NASA's Earth observing satellites add to the data gathering.
Such sensing capabilities enable new opportunities to provide actionable information, detect problems and improve life, while at the same time imply severe ethical issues if misused.
Big Data management and processing, including timing and synchronization, in an equitable manner resulting in high quality results is a major technical challenge.
When does the problem come to a head?
Time: Now to 15yrs
Rate: Linearly to exponentially increasing impact
The technology and infrastructure for ubiquitous sensing is already available or being established with some populations presently participating and impacted. The economic and societal drivers for their implementation are expected to generate broader implementation in the nearer term.
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?

Ubiquitous Sensing
System architectures and business models that allow incorporation of equity management mechanisms
Use of democratized data gathering for early warning systems impacting safety and welfare
AI, IoT, Wearables will allow people to create routing models and recommendations for vehicles
Relationship: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level.

Improved sensing capabilities in & above the water / ice caps.
Implementation of Big Data management of the ubiquitous sensing networks in an equitable manner resulting in high quality results.
What trends are driving this capability or need that may influence the problem or solution space?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances that allow ubiquitous monitoring, combined with Big Data processing and communications, means that the infrastructure structure for Ubiquitous Sensing both on a personal and societal level already exists.
Economic drivers are moving towards use of monitoring technologies to drive specific outcomes, not necessarily for the benefit of the population.
Privacy concerns are declining among younger generations: decline in need for privacy with respect to certain areas of life may allow wearables to be used to communicate more broadly as part of IoT using cloud
TinyML may enable wearables to be powerful computers, recommendation engines
Broad sensing system capabilities are both becoming more pervasive and more easily implemented enabling a new level of monitoring and surveillance.

<Scenario>
(gpt-4) 
In the not-so-distant future, we find a world grappling with the consequences of climate change, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), and the increasing capabilities of surveillance technology. These global challenges and opportunities touch everyone, yet they disproportionately impact communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which often bear the brunt of climate change effects and are least equipped to adapt to or influence AI and surveillance technologies.

Imagine a coastal community in one such LMIC. The rising sea levels, a direct consequence of climate change, threaten their homes and livelihoods. However, their voices are often unheard in international climate policy discussions. Their limited resources and access to technology make it hard for them to adapt to these changes or participate in mitigation efforts.

Meanwhile, the world around them is becoming increasingly digital. AI systems are transforming economies, Surveillance technologies are becoming ubiquitous, and wearable devices that could help detect and warn of disasters are out of their reach due to economic constraints. These communities are at risk of being left behind or, worse, exploited as the world around them transforms.

This scenario is not just a possibility but a reality for many communities around the world today. The ethical impact of these changes is significant and global, affecting billions of people. The aviation industry is uniquely positioned to influence these challenges, from contributing to climate change mitigation to leveraging AI for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.

However, there are significant gaps in understanding and addressing these problems. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of AI and surveillance technologies are equitably distributed and do not infringe on human rights. We also need to involve the most affected communities in climate change solutions and ensure their voices are heard.

The potential impacts of these issues are well known, but the specific outcomes and how they will evolve are uncertain.

Battery Pack Modelling,TTT Green Aviation,,"Battery Pack Modelling Proposal Electro-Chemical & Structural-Thermal pack modelling proposal for TTT / Green Aviation Call, 2023 1) Problem, Objectives, Approach, and Anticipated Benefits: Many of novel aircraft concepts include some degree of electrification to reduce carbon footprint. To date, the battery models that have been able to be incorporated into NASA aircraft preliminary design studies such as the quadrotor0F 1 have been cell-level models1F 2, with knockdown factors for pack-level effects. There is an interest from EPFD, TTT, AATT, and other projects, in being able to more accurately model and optimize pack-level structural and thermal effects in addition to the cell-level effects. However, to date, there was no clear path on how this could be accomplished while still being compatible with cutting edge gradient-based aircraft optimization tools like OpenMDAO2F 3 and Aviary3F 4. The objective of this research proposal is to create an open-source battery pack model that includes cell electro-chemical effects as well as pack-level structural-thermal effects. The resulting model will be differentiable to ensure compatibility with OpenMDAO and Aviary. Our approach is to create a multi-center team and use open-source tools that we are already familiar with to create a system-level battery pack design. Figure 1 shows an Extended Design Structure Matrix (XDSM) diagram that details of how each of the component disciplines fits together to make the overall battery-pack model. In Figure 1, Discharge curves from cell-tests are input into the cell electro-chemical model which allows for the configuration of the parameters of the cell and later analysis. The cell electro-chemical effects based on models from ProgPy4F 5. A CAD model of the pack (multiple cells) is then created and imported along with the number of packs into the structural-thermal model TACS5F 6. The TACS software performs structural analysis to evaluate the mass of the pack as well as configure parameters for use later in the analysis. At this point the battery pack will be run through a sample mission which will primarily consist of pulling a specified quantity of amps at a particular voltage from the system over a given amount of time. During the mission, the cell electro-chemical model will keep track of the state of charge and voltage of the cells. TACS will keep track of the temperature throughout the pack subject to the heat produced by each cell and a assuming a constant cooling flow. Figure 2 (left) shows an example compliant battery pack designed and (right) a TACS structural-thermal pack model. Both of these models were designed by team members on this proposal. 1 E.

This will enable better understanding of the trade-space for electrified aircraft studies. Additionally, by open sourcing the model and publishing a paper on it, this will provide other researchers in government, academia and industry with an understanding of how they can use the same methods to create their own higher fidelity battery pack models. 2) Milestones and how to Evaluate Success: • January 2024 – CAD Battery pack model completed • April 2024 – Cell electro-chem model input constraints narrowed to decrease multimodality of solution space. • April 2024 – Demonstrate TACS successfully ingesting CAD pack model and producing weights. • July 2024 – Overall pack subsystem linked together, and first optimization / analysis run. Preliminary paperwork filed for open-source release. SciTech 2025 abstract submitted. • September 2024 – Battery pack optimization completed. Optimization will vary wall thickness in one or more parts of the pack model. The optimization objective will be minimum mass while completing the mission objective based on a pre-determined voltage and amperage draw. Repository is released open source. 3) Next Steps and Areas for Transition: Completion of this work through open-source code release and publishing in SciTech 2025 would immediately enable TTT, AATT, and EPFD projects to use the pack-level model created to investigate specific battery pack and cell chemistries for electrified aircraft studies like the TTBW. This is a higher level of fidelity than they can currently achieve with the cell-only models that currently exist. Additionally, academic partners like U. Michigan, Georgia Tech, and Iowa State, could immediately take the models created from this work and integrate them into their electrified aircraft studies that they perform on an ongoing basis using simplified battery models. Further work would need to be performed in order to parameterize the pack-model into something that could handle changing the number of cells inside the pack without engineer input. CAD modelling of the pack, while useful for an initial design, is a time-consuming process that parametrization should help to simplify. Additionally, parameterization enables the optimizer to trade battery pack design for other aspects of the aircraft like thermal system mass and wing volume. 4) Challenge Scenario In the case where a subset of the analysis was infeasible, (i.e. if ProgPy was not capable of supplying the cell electro-chemical models but the other aspects of the thermal-structural analysis were working well,) we would use one of our other cell models or create a new cell model as a substitute. This scenario has happened multiple times in the past with other projects and we have been successful at finding substitute models. In the case where the entire approach was invalid, we could shift our focus to leveraging an already working battery cell model and enhancing it with better pack-level estimates for weight. While this would not be as thorough as analyzing the full structural-thermal system, it would still provide for increased fidelity which will provide useful for aircraft design studies. Regardless of what challenges appear before the team during this work, the entire team will be involved in the decision-making process of how to pivot and still create useful advancements in battery pack modelling for electrified aircraft design.",,,,,,,,,
Effects of Atmospheric Conditions and Sustainable Fuels on Contrail Radiative Forcing,TTT Green Aviation,,"1
TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT
FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL
Title: Effects of Atmospheric Conditions and Sustainable Fuels on Contrail Radiative Forcing
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits).
Executive summary
Contrails create about two-thirds of aviation’s contribution to climate change. To guarantee the success
of contrail mitigation strategies such as flight altitude changes, the sensitivity of contrail optical depth to
atmospheric parameters must be quantified with the associated uncertainty. Additionally, impact from
both SAF and hydrogen needs to be studied: Are future aviation fuels more or less prone to contrails?
We address these concerns by applying modeling, simulation, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to
contrails to assess and reduce the aviation’s impact on global warming.
What problem are you solving?
Current estimates of the
anthropogenic radiative forcing (RF)
due to aviation are crippled by a very
high level of uncertainty. This
uncertainty comes from non-CO2
processes in the formation and
persistence of contrails[1]. To address
it rigorously, the influence of the local
atmospheric conditions (which are
only known up to a certain degree of
confidence from weather models)
must be propagated through contrail
simulations. Similarly, the effect of the
chemical composition of the jet exhaust gas (also a large source of uncertainty) must be factored in to
enable predictions for different types of engines and fuels, such as SAF and H2, and unconventional aircraft
technologies, such as Quesst. Eventually, we aim to predict the optical properties of the contrails and the
related confidence interval, given uncertain inputs.
Has someone tried to solve this problem before? If no one has attempted to solve this problem
before, why not?
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of contrails has been performed in several research groups (reviewed in [2]).
The current state-of-the-art methodologies can handle contrails from conventional airplanes using regular
jet fuels. To alleviate computational cost, contrail simulations typically use a time-developing framework,
where the streamwise direction of the flow is replaced by periodicity conditions. Assuming Galilean
invariance, the simulation is performed in a moving frame with a constant translation speed equal to the
free stream velocity.
Figure 1: Spatially developing wake simulation using VPM [3].

Where did they go wrong?
1. No formal quantification of the uncertainty has been performed to date. At most, simple parametric
studies have been conducted [4].
2. Only few works have simulated contrails from SAF [5], and virtually none from H2. There is a need to
improve simulation codes and models so they can handle situations with fewer aerosols and/or soot
particles which in turn affect the nucleation and growth of ice particles.
3. The effect of the time-developing assumption on the simulation results has never been quantified.
However, it impedes physical processes that involve axial velocities (since they are not Galilean
invariant). Consequences on the mixing in the plume and the ensuing contrail RF must be studied.
What is different about your approach? How does your proposed work transform current
capabilities, tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches?
Our simulations will address the above shortcomings as follows:
1. Use of QUEST (NASA UQ software) to propagate uncertainty through the simulations.
2. Use of a Lagrangian super particle approach to deal with the microphysics of ice nucleation in a variety
of environments, with different concentration of aerosols/soot particles and diverse background
conditions (humidity, temperature, stratification, etc.), specifically targeting the microphysics of SAF
and H2 contrails.
3. Use of a Vortex Particle-Mesh (VPM) approach to perform regular space developing simulations (as
opposed to time-developing) at a moderate computational cost (Figure 1) and quantify the model
error associated with the time-developing assumption by comparing with regular LES performed with
the code NTMIX.
In these efforts we will collaborate with Stanford Univ. (Dr. Tania Ferreira, Prof. Catherine Gorle, Prof.
Juan Alonso) and Poly. Montreal (Prof. Roberto Paoli) to cross-validate our simulations and models.
If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable?
Our simulation results will lead to parameterizations and surrogate models based on machine learning
(ML) techniques trained on our simulation results. Such models can then be used to improve climate
models and devise efficient contrail mitigation strategies (see sect.3).
Potential customers: FAA, airframe and engine manufacturers, policy planners, etc.

5 Analyze uncertainty with respect to the aerosol content and
ice nucleation modes of hydrogen/SAF combustion
Study ready to be
published/disseminated.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential
areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
• Our parameterization should be implemented in global circulation models to better quantify the nonCO2 impact of aviation on climate change and the related uncertainty.
• Air traffic trajectory should be optimized under uncertainty. Mitigating non-CO2 effects is challenging
because it usually increases direct CO2 effects. Efficient strategies should use the information about
uncertainty from our models to target the operational adaptations that have the highest likelihood of
making a positive overall impact. This connects with the transition goals of ATM-X.
• Future research should focus on reducing the uncertainty in the inputs to our models. One example
is the predicted humidity at high altitude, which will require refinement of current weather simulation
and forecasting methods.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three months
into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach
is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What
alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
Let us first note that:
• Two independent simulation codes will be used: NTMIX and VPM. This mitigates the risk since it is
highly unlikely that neither will work for the intended problem. Both codes have been used in the past
for similar problems.
• If UQ does not work with QUEST, other software can be used such as DAKOTA.
• If ML does not work for the parameterization (e.g., because too much data is required to train the
model), we can rely on more conventional method for surrogate modeling such as kriging.
In the unlikely event that the initial approach is unfeasible because none of the simulation codes work,
we could redirect the focus of this project in several ways. For example:
• Contrails can only persist in the atmosphere in ice super-saturated regions (ISSR). Predicting the
position and spatial extent of these ISSR is notoriously difficult. We could work on improving the
modeling of ISSR using a combination of numerical weather predictions, observational data, and
machine learning.
• The interaction between a contrail, the ensuing contrail cirrus, and natural cirrus clouds is not well
understood. We could work on improving ice/mixed cloud modeling using Lagrangian capabilities like
those we envisioned for the proposed work.

Title: Improved Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) Simulations for Design, Analysis and Optimization of Both Airframe and Propulsor 

Description of the work  

Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) at NASA is inadequate for addressing subsonic transport Mach numbers and higher, as well as distortion for blades with a lot of twist consistent of typical high bypass ratio turbofans for relatively quick design-study or optimization types of runs.  PAI capability for design understanding is critical for getting improved performance of aircraft and to meet key sustainability goals of NASA. The current codes have actuator disk capability for steady simulations which are inadequate or have the ability to run time accurate with rotating blades installed but require thousands of CPUs and thousands of CPU/GPU hours to run.   

The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD), a TTBW configuration is designated as the X-66A as shown on the left of Figure 1.  It consists of a Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan.  That configuration can be simulated under existing cruise conditions using existing NASA CFD tools where the propulsor can be modeled as either an actuator disk or with appropriate boundary condition at the Nacelle inlet and exhausts.  Crosswind configurations or very high angles of attack will be more difficult or not possible with those same tools.  On the right of Figure 1 is the Open Fan concept engine that GE is currently developing in their partnership with CFM International.  Having this architecture engine on the TTBW and simulating with existing NASA tools would not produce an accurate description of the interaction unless one spent months getting one unsteady result.  This capability is not only lacking at NASA, but in the industry as well.  Improved PAI simulation capability that can be done relatively quickly can allow for reduced fuel burn through modifications of the propulsor and airframe at the same time.

Two NASA codes are widely used for Aircraft Simulation: FUN3D developed out of NASA Langley, and LAVA developed out of NASA Ames.  The proposed approach would be valid for both codes but would be explored with this TTT effort first using FUN3D.  The approach is to use volumetric source terms as well as the physical blockage to represent the impact of the propulsor (fan, Open Fan, or Propellor) rotor on the steady and stationary flowfield (the rotor effects are smeared out).  The physical blockage is known from the thickness distributions of the blades and their stagger angle.  The source terms would first come from current unsteady solutions and then from first-principal models that have been developed by others and can be improved by propulsion experts, AI (trained from unsteady simulations), and using test data. 

 

Currently, FUN3D has an excellent actuator model [1] shown in Fig 2.  It allows for circumferential variations in flow quantities and is adjoint capable.  The method uses a low-speed blade element theory and does not account for the propulsor blockage.  LAVA has actuator disk capability, a volumetric source term capability but without blockage, and without production adjoint capability.   

 

 

Figure 2.  Actuator Disk capability in FUN3D shown for PEGASUS concept [1].  

 

Rod Chima retired from NASA and had added a source term and blockage capability to his turbomachinery code, SWIFT [2].  This code is structured multi-block, is not in active use at NASA, and was not applied to aircraft.  It was used for turbomachinery only.  

 

The volume sources with blockage terms are outlined in a paper by Xie and Uranga [3] and the equations below come from this paper.  This method builds on work by David Hall in his MIT PhD work but added the blockage terms.  The blockage term, b, represents the blade thickness in the circumferential direction, 
𝜃
𝜃
 
, and by the number of blades, B, and is defined by  

 

and the equations of motion have the added source terms f in the momentum and energy equation: 

 

These equations are implicit in the code, APNASA, but those terms come a different model.   

 

For this proposal, the source terms will come first from averaging (in time) the time dependent solution of an undistorted propulsor and a distorted propulsor.  The distorted propulsor will be the BLI2DTF case [4,5] that has been run experimentally and for which a Turbo [6] has been used coupled with LAVA.  Following that, the source terms will come from the models outlined in references [2,3].  Turbo will be used to demonstrate the source terms and to implement the blockage terms since it is a simpler code than FUN3D and is used extensively for Turbomachinery simulations at NASA. 

 

Another key aspect is that T-Blade3 [7], a turbomachinery geometry generator, will be used to define the geometry of the propulsor including the camber line, thickness and then the entire 3D turbomachinery blade.  It has been effectively used at NASA and for NASA applications since 2015. It is parametric and fully differentiated so applicable for eventual adjoint-enabled optimization. 

 

Describe the anticipated milestones  

The following work tasks are proposed.  Each task completion would be a low or higher level milestone. 

Add blockage terms to Turbo by GRC Aeromechanics group 

demonstration using TURBO for BLI2DTS case.  The source terms come from very careful averaging of the unsteady simulation 

demonstration using TURBO with Spacefan* with and without blockage terms 

Model source terms in TURBO with basic loss model and knowing geometry and rpm 

use source terms (without blockage terms) with Fun3D for spacefan and compare to Turbo without blockage terms 

Define the changes needed in FUN3D for blockage terms 

Define geometry integration with T-Blade3 and Fun3D with loss and turning model 

Outline 2nd year efforts 

Each of these tasks would be done to demonstrate capability and not be done with the most rigor necessary for complete understanding.  Tasks 1 will require modifications of the TURBO source code as well as adding the source terms to Turbo.  Source terms input into FUN3D would require a small change of source code in FUN3D. 

*   The Spacefan case is a convenient low-speed ventilation fan designed for the ISS.   

 

Next Steps 

The following tasks would be necessary after the first year: 

Add blockage terms to the equations of motion in FUN3D. 

Demonstrate a low speed wing with a propeller with source terms 

Use adjoint to modify the wing spanwise with effect of propeller 

Choose a test case such as TTBW with OpenFan to demonstrate full capability. 

Alternative approaches?  

Since many of the steps have already been done in other contexts, the biggest risk to this approach is the aggressiveness of the schedule.  It would be focused more after a detailed assessment is done for each of the tasks.

Title: Technical and economic trade study on using Photo-and-Photovoltaic-Batteries in
Tandem with conventional or novel LH2 for long-haul (inter-continental) flights.
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you
solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What
is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why

Green aviation faces multiple challenges (technical, processing, resources, and economic). To realize this
vision, the aviation industry needs to solve various parts (energy storage, propulsion, supply chain,
recyclability, and safety) of the puzzle. Short-haul flights could be solved using battery technology alone,
it is unlikely that long-haul or intercontinental flights would be able to run on battery technology in the
foreseeable future. There are a few alternative ideas proposed in the literature such as sustainable aviation
fuel (SAF), hydrogen propulsion, fuel cells, and hybrid electric vehicles, however, each of these faces its
own technical, economic, and climate challenges.
Any hybrid solution will require a separate battery to store energy, in addition to any backup or auxiliary
systems. In such cases, the battery will occupy precious volume and mass in an aircraft. In addition, these
batteries will need to be quickly recharged at an airport since other fuels require less turnaround time. This
leads to two possible solutions, either fast charging at the destination or charging during the cruise portion
of the flight (which is also the low-power portion of the flight). One possible solution is a photon or a
photovoltaic battery, such a combined solution could reduce weight, use amble solar energy above the cloud
cover, and charge the battery during flight. Note that NASA has envisioned solar cell-driven aircraft with
Helios and Pathfinder in the past, but these efforts were limited to unmanned aircraft. Thus, some of the
techniques and technologies can be leveraged. One of the major shortcomings of a solar cell (apart from
low efficiency) is that it must be connected to a battery or other energy storage device, or a micro-grid to
store/distribute the electricity it generates.
For this project, we propose a high-level techno-eco-sustainability study to investigate the potential benefit
of combining energy storage and photovoltaics into a single integrated solution. However, a combination
of these technologies is in a nascent stage with some explored integration ideas [1], choosing a
photosensitive material as an electrode or putting a PV or a battery as an integrated package (Fig. 1), for
combining photovoltaics with batteries. One of the challenges is that the efficiency of a combined system
is about 10%, significantly lower than a single junction (about 20% [2]), as well as current state-of-the-art
multi-junction devices (the maximum efficiency is greater than 45%). Another approach that is being
developed is to use persistent phosphor for ""Photon Energy-Storage"". Here the photon energy is thermal
energy, which can be converted through an electrochemical or a photovoltaic route.
Figure 1: Different photo-charging techniques: a) closed system, b) integrated solution.
The research in developing a technology can be significant and it is often necessary to develop trade-offs
to venture into a new technology that is still nascent. Here we propose to perform a techno-economicenvironmental impact to understand the practicality of pursuing improving either technology while,
performing the life-cycle-assessment of materials used in the technology and its environmental impact
during the materials life-process (extraction, processing, reuse capability).
Developing a trade study from a material, technology, recyclable, integration, supply chain, and greenness
in addition to the viability of a novel technology can provide a good decision tool for new technologies.
For this study, we will investigate the viability of photon-thermal/electrochemical energy conversion and
storage for electric aviation.
a) b)
The work will focus on three aspects: 1) Safety, a combination of volatile electrolytes, and low
melting point materials with photovoltaics could generate heat that could be catastrophic. A simple
thermal analysis will be performed to identify safety risks; 2) techno-economic-recyclability, using
the Circular Economy Modeling and Analysis tool [3] from NREL will be used to perform
technical, economic, and recyclability of technology and supply chains. Lastly, Environmental
Sustainability: A comparative LCA with a cradle-to-gate approach will be performed using
NREL’s GREET (The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies
Model) software [4]. The platform evaluates the material and energy flows for battery and
photovoltaic materials from raw material extraction to device production.
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon
completion.
The study is divided into 3 parts and will have 3 milestones: 1) weight benefits should exceed 20%,
while safety should be similar or better than a hybrid system; 2) techno-economic-recyclability,
material availability and recyclability should be like the hybrid system; 3) LCA analysis should reveal
the complete life-cycle reduces carbon emissions (or carbon costs) similar to the hybrid system.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the
potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
If the trade-study reveals that either photon or a photo battery is beneficial to either hybrid-aircraft or
future electric aviation focused airports, then the next step would be to work on identifying technology
bottlenecks and solving them from a material or performance perspective. For (hypothetical) example,
if photo battery was found viable for hybrid-aircraft, next step would be to focus on improving energy
conversion efficiency, changing material to provide higher voltages, or charging rate of these photobatteries. Since this is a trade study, if viable it would also allow us to focus on infrastructural, material
processing, device optimization, system optimization, or improving material efficiency.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three
months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial
proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining,
how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
It is unlikely that a trade-study reveals nothing, since by nature the goal of it is to identify feasibility on
various fronts. But if the project’s outcome is that either photon or a photo battery is beneficial, the
next step would be to focus on the technological challenge for the rest of the year. However, if it was
found that neither of them would be reasonable either from an economic or safety perspective, then
depending on the barrier, if it is the battery coupling, then solar cell could be explored for generating
O2 and H2 for a fuel cell. However, if solar cell is found limiting, then the framework for feasibility
study environmental friendly cradle-to-grave analysis for materials and process for batteries and fuelcells are developed which could be used to apply to other challenging studies.

Climate change is the greatest threat to humanity.  We are in a race to develop solutions that maintain and improve quality of life without intensifying causes of climate change.  The development of electrified aircraft allows humanity to maintain civilization with less carbon emissions. One challenge to electrification of aircraft is the mass of batteries required to sustain flight significantly limits the aircraft payload and flight duration.  We propose the inclusion of high voltage, thin film, perovskite based solar arrays laminated onto the aircraft wings and fuselage in production. The integration of these solar cells offset power density needs for batteries for electrified aircraft reducing weight. When coupled with a fuselage manufactured from light weight next generation materials.  

 

Outfitting an electric airplane with perovskite solar cells would offset power density needs for the Lithium ion batteries, reducing weight.  If we assume a 737 airplane traveling from NYC to LA on a sunny day, with modest 20% efficient perovskite solar cells integrated, the solar cells would generate 320 kWhr of energy on that flight. This is achieved with just 1.2 kg of perovskite solar cells total mass over the plane. That energy allows a mass reduction of 1200 kg of lithium ion batteries. These ultralight weight solar cells save 1200 kg of battery mass. Perovskites are especially propitious for photovoltaic application due to their exceptional properties, such as large-charge carrier diffusion lengths [1], long carrier lifetimes, strong optical absorption [2], weak exciton binding [3], and favorable band gaps [2]. Perovskite based photovoltaics are thin films (300-500 nm) light weight, low cost, and are compatible with solution or vapor phase processing techniques. Multi-junction (tandem) solar cells consisting of multiple light absorbers with considerably different bandgaps show great potential in breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of a single junction solar cell (33%) by absorbing light in a broader range of wavelengths.[4] These tandem solar cells are expected to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 25.2% (with theoretical limits of 42%) and are 500X thinner than the current state of the art (SOA) technology.  Perovskite solar cells also absorb light more strongly than SOA GaAs solar cells. 

 

My previous research has led to the development of single junction perovskite solar cell at reproducible 20% power conversion efficiency that can withstand the harsh low earth environment and are stable to terrestrial stressors. We can apply lessons learned from that effort to develop a lightweight low-cost perovskite based tandem photovoltaic capable of greater power output. We will select materials suitable for the wide bandgap (1.7-1.9 eV) second junction solar cell and we will demonstrate the ability to fabricate these cells, regardless of solvent compatibility, with a lamination technique that has been demonstrated to be effective with perovskite interlayers.[5]  

 

Electrified aircraft is a newer venture with the first passenger electric aircraft, Alice, flight in September 2022.  Long duration unmanned air vehicles augmented with photovoltaics like the AeroVironment Helios vehicle have demonstrated feasibility of solar and fuel cell powered aerial vehicles.  These vehicles have currently been limited to small payload vehicles as mass is limited.  Emerging photovoltaic technologies, like those based on perovskites, allow for previously unachievable specific powers (W/kg).  When compared to the state of the art III-V or Silicon solar cells, perovskites  

 

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

MS1: Demonstration of lamination of single junction perovskite solar cell with heat press showing the feasibility of the process to combine two junctions together to form a tandem cell. 

MS2: Material down selection for wide bandgap second junction active layer material with special considerations for efficiency, durability, and manufacturability.  

MS3: Model the electrical performance of the second junction solar cell with primary candidate material. 

MS4: Deposit and characterize the optical and electrical performance of the wide bandgap perovskite material.  

This work should be evaluated on the delivery of materials identified and selected for the second junction wide bandgap perovskite solar cell.  This work should also be evaluated on the computational predicted performance of the resulting tandem device. The proposed tandem device efficiency, manufacturability, and durability should be considered.  

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

The next steps of this research should include deposition of the champion wide bandgap perovskite active layer for the second junction. We will then use the lamination technique to combine the first and second junction of the devices to yield a tandem perovskite based photovoltaic. We will perform local optimization to increase the power conversion efficiency and test the cell in relevant environmental stressors including humidity and thermal stresses. 

This work has applications in both the terrestrial and space markets. Potential transition to TACP or GCD can facilitate further technical development and advancement of technology readiness level.  There are also many small businesses and universities in this area so SBIR/STTR opportunities could facilitate tech transfer and commercialization.   

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

If, three months into this work, I discovered that our lamination technique was not feasible for the materials I selected, I would first revisit where in the stack I was laminating. There may be a different material layer more suited to undergo this process.  If that did not resolve the technical challenges I would revisit materials selection, guided by literature, and alter my deposition technique either to omit the need for lamination or to ensure compatibility. We will use a combination of the literature, evidence-based decision making, computational modeling, and experimental materials development to design a wide bandgap perovskite photovoltaic that will supplement the absorption of existing perovskite solar cell providing a path toward energy augmentation for electrified aircraft.

contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because of the mix of climate
pollutants it generates. A recent model analyzed the CO2 and non-CO2 effects (like nitrogen oxide
emissions and contrail formation) to assess aviation's total warming footprint. The report found aviation
contributed approximately 4% to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being
responsible for only 2.4% of global annual emissions of CO2.(1)
One solution to the continued impact of aviation on climate change is a shift toward Sustainable
Aviation Fuels (SAFs), such as hydrogen. The European Clean Aviation Initiative reports that hydrogen
power can be part of the green aviation solution in that hydrogen power completely eliminates
CO2 emissions and can be produced carbon-free. Considering non-CO2 emissions as well, the latest
estimates show that hydrogen combustion could reduce the climate impact of flight by up to 75%, and
fuel-cell propulsion by up to 90%.(2) The Clean Sky 2 Program, which is part of the Clean Aviation
Initiative found that hydrogen either for fuel cells, direct burn in gas turbine engines or as a building
block for synthetic liquid fuels could feasibly power aircraft with entry into service by 2035 for shortrange aircraft at a cost of less than $20 extra per person on a short-range flight, and reducing climate
impact by 50 to 90%. (3)
Problem: While a clear pay-off exists for hydrogen powered aircraft, the physical space required to carry
gaseous hydrogen is large, requiring cryogenic storage hydrogen fuel as a liquid, at -253oC. The
successful utilization of lightweight carbon fiber/polymer composite tanks has met challenges cycling to
this temperature, the primary challenge being microcracking of the matrix.
Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Composite cryotanks have been evaluated by industry
and Government for decades.(4) The most common materials and manufacturing approach for
composite tanks has been autoclave consolidated carbon fiber and epoxy composite. As the tank is
subjected to repeated fill/drain cycles, the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion between
the carbon fiber reinforcement and epoxy matrix leads to residual stresses in the laminated tank wall
resulting in matrix microcracking (5). This was addressed by the NASA Composite Cryotank Technology
Demonstration Project in 2013 by using thin plies to reduce interlaminar stresses. This approach was
successful in reducing, but not eliminating microcracking. Once microcracking starts, it cannot be
repaired in an epoxy matrix cryotank. In addition, the epoxy matrix material is cured in an autoclave
which is a high energy process and requires the use of non-recyclable/ non-reusable consumable
materials.
A separate materials option for composite cryotanks is carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics.
Thermoplastic matrix composites offer greater compliance than the traditional epoxy (thermoset)
matrix materials and therefore the potential to reduce matrix microcracking. There has been limited
research using thermoplastics due to manufacturing challenges such as low drapability of the composite
prepreg and the requirement for high processing temperatures. Recent developments in low melt
temperature materials and automated manufacturing provide new opportunities for this material class.
Thermoplastic composites are receiving attention for cryogen storage, most notably a study is currently
underway in the Netherlands to build and evaluate thermoset and thermoplastics composites for liquid
hydrogen cryotanks for commercial aircraft. (6)
Where did they go wrong/what is different about this approach: We propose to focus on
thermoplastics, and pushing a step further than the European study we propose to experimentally and
analytically evaluate thermoplastic composites for (a) viability as a composite cryo-tank material for
hydrogen, (b) repairability of microcracking within the matrix to increase the lifetime and reduce waste
and (c) reduce the cost and environmental impact of manufacturing relative to the state-of-the-art
autoclave consolidation through use of thermoplastic welding options, such as ultrasonic welding.
If successful the proposed work will enable hydrogen-based propulsion opportunities within the aviation
industry, energy savings in manufacturing, and increased safety through repairability of the
thermoplastic tank.
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. The
key performance requirement for a composite cryo-tank is that it holds cryogenic liquid. Microcracking
has been identified as the primary path for cryogen loss through the tank wall, therefore the feasibility
of microcrack mitigation and repair will be the focus of this initial effort.
a. State-of-the-Art (SOA) assessment and partner identification. The past 3-5 years have seen a
resurgence of U.S. based research with thermoplastic matrix composites leading to rapid
advances in manufacturing and materials testing.
i. A SOA assessment will be used to establish baseline metrics for consolidation quality for
composites manufactured out of the autoclave and repaired composites.
ii. A partner will be identified for ultrasonic welding of thermoplastic composites. NASA
GRC has current contracts for thermoplastic welding with Agile Ultrasonics in Columbus
Ohio. This is for flat coupon welds, (as opposed to a tank)
iii. Feasibility assessment will be performed to ‘trade’ thermoset and thermoplastic
composite materials through analysis. Existing database properties will be used.
b. Assess feasibility of sustainable (out-of-autoclave) manufacturing: build upon NASA’s recent
experience with thermoplastic welding to demonstrate out-of autoclave consolidation of flat
panels and plates.
i. Establish industry partnership for out-of-autoclave manufacturing via ultrasonic welding
methods.
- Manufacture flat panels to generate test coupons for compression
strength and interlaminar shear strength.
- Manufacture cylindrical components to demonstrate manufacturing at
the subcomponent level.
- Finite element analysis to for failure prediction.
- Evaluate consolidation quality through standard inspection techniques
and baseline mechanical tests.
ii. Establish in-house capability for ultrasonic welding.
- Manufacture flat panels to generate compression and interlaminar
shear strength test coupons for comparison to industry fabricated parts.
- Manufacture cylindrical components to demonstrate manufacturing at
the subcomponent level.
- Evaluate consolidation quality through standard inspection techniques
and baseline mechanical tests.
- Data comparison between in-house and industry manufactured parts
will be used to inform in-house process development.
c. Assess feasibility of microcrack repair: utilize established welding techniques to re-melt/heal
microcracks in the composite matrix.
i. Induce microcracking in the thermoplastic composite through cycling to cryogenic
temperature.
ii. Repair the cracks through ultrasonic welding methods.
iii. Mechanical testing of repaired coupons for comparison to pristine
d. Budget: Costs for this project are associated with materials, manufacturing, and test. This
includes a contract for ultrasonic welding (out of autoclave consolidation) while concurrently
building the capability in-house.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? This work will establish
feasibility of the material class to enable sustainable aviation through reduced energy manufacturing
and a transition to hydrogen fuel. Next steps include but are not limited to the following.
a. Establish a team with expertise in the requirements of hydrogen powered aviation to define
requirements of the composite tank and support structure.
b. Establish a team to design the tank and support structure including connections, fittings,
baffles/slosh mitigation, fuel lines, etc.
c. Establish a design and analysis team to ensure margins of safety are met for the cryo-tank.
d. Develop analysis tools to predict microcracking based on micromechanics models.
e. Follow the building block approach to manufacture and test from the coupon to the component
level.
Potential area of transition includes the Commercially Viable Hydrogen Aircraft for Reduction of
Greenhouse Emissions Project.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three months
into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not
feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative
approaches or methods would you pursue?
a. For this effort there are multiple paths to address this scenarioi. We have proposed two technology developments, lightweight composite tank, and
energy savings through out of autoclave manufacturing. The energy savings in
manufacturing is the higher risk component of this proposal due to challenges in
meeting the consolidation quality achieved in an autoclave. If deemed technically infeasible we can focus on the composite tank in a traditional manufacturing
environment.
ii. Second option would be to shift the focus away from tanks and move to more energy
efficient manufacturing for aircraft structures. This is work we had started through CIF
funding and can continue.

FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE 

Title:  Robust Repair and Refurbishment Technologies Enabling Reusability and Life Extension of Ceramic Matrix Composites Propulsion Components  

Advanced silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composite components are currently in service and being further developed for insertion in several turbine engine applications. The advantages of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) over metals include lower weight, higher temperature capability and stability, and corrosion resistance while the advantages over monolithic (non-fiber reinforced) ceramics include damage tolerance, graceful failure, and thermal shock resistance. CMC turbine engine components offer significant performance benefits of reduced cooling, fuel burn, and emissions (NOx and COx), however, the materials are relatively expensive with complex manufacturing required for the integrated constituents of the CMC. During service, the CMC components (e.g. turbine blades, vanes, shrouds, and combustor liners) experience degradation in performance due to various forms of damage including oxidation, impact damage, erosion, surface spallation, and delamination. Currently, as CMC parts wear out and, in some cases, when cooling channels within CMCs are degraded or clogged, they need to be replaced with brand new parts. The continuous replacement of CMC components will be quite expensive given the high acquisition cost of components. It will also contribute to material waste and a higher demand for labor, time, and energy resources during their fabrication compared to that of refurbished parts.  

Currently, metallic turbine engine components are regularly repaired and refurbished during engine overhauls to extend life of components. This repair and refurbishment provide significant cost savings, extends reliability, safety, and life of components as well as reduce wastes. However, looking at the ceramic matrix composite landscape, no viable repair or refurbishment technology is available. At GRC, we have significant experience in developing repair and refurbishment technologies for space shuttle leading edges (C/C composites) and a collaborative program with Goodrich Corp. for the C/C composite aircraft brake repair and refurbishment.  These technologies were developed at high TRL level and wide variety of testing was conducted.  

We propose to advance the state-of-the-art by developing methods to repair and refurbish SiC/SiC CMCs to retain material performance requirements and extend their service life thus reducing waste. As of now, there are no suitable methods to extend the life of damaged CMCs using repair and refurbishment technologies. One method investigated by other researchers is the self-healing of cracked CMCs by forming glasses in the matrix or coating which melt and flow to fill in cracks (ref. 1-2). However, the formed glass can only slowdown the oxidation in the vicinity of a matrix crack without contributing to CMC mechanical load carrying capability. Also, low melting glasses are not appropriate as they create stress corrosion, vaporization, and reduce service life. Currently used CMCs do not have any glass forming constituents due to these reasons. Any repair and refurbishment technology should not only be able to repair only cracks but other forms of CMC damage such as cooling channels restoration. It should also avoid potential chemical incompatibility with the CMCs and/or their environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). Furthermore, the self-healing crack methods have temperature capabilities well below the SiC/SiC maximum service temperature of 2400°F and especially the new target of 2700°F for next generation SiC/SiC. A group from Boeing has investigated patches for repairing space shuttle leading edges (ref. 3). Their approach does not seem to have been fully developed or reported. The leading-edge patches are not fully processed until earth-atmosphere-reentry heating where the high reentry temperatures act to pyrolyze the material. At NASA GRC, Dr. Mrityunjay Singh, who is part of this proposal, had developed “Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair (GRABER) (refs. 4-8)”, which was successfully used for repairing reinforced carbon/carbon composite (RCC) with different types of damage (cracks, spallation, delamination, etc). The verification and qualification testing was carried out in arc-jet testing facilities at NASA JSC, NASA Ames, and Boeing LCAT facilities in St. Louis, MO. He has also worked with largest US aircraft brake manufacturer for the repair and refurbishment of C/C composite aircraft brakes. Experience gained from the assessment of CMC damage and repair techniques will be leveraged for our specific case of SiC/SiC CMCs for turbine engine applications with an emphasis on retaining mechanical properties and environmental stability in a steam environment. Engine combustion environments are rich in water vapor which can cause reactions and surface recession and degradation of SiC/SiC materials.  

The approach is to develop a method for the repair and refurbishment of SiC/SiC CMCs. Material compositions will be developed and evaluated. Processing conditions will be optimized. Various types of flaws (e.g. surface, through holes, and de-laminations) will be introduced into the CMC test specimens. For larger flaws, a preform of SiC woven cloth will be integrated with the repair materials for maintaining CMC structural integrity. The ability for the repair and patch methods to retain mechanical strength and environmental durability will be assessed. Testing of tensile coupons while under a mechanical stress in a steam environment will be conducted to compare the performance of undamaged, damaged & unrepaired, and damaged & repaired CMCs. The results will be analyzed to determine repair effectiveness. Correlations will be made between material microstructures, processing conditions, and properties.  

CMC materials and lab equipment are available for the activity. Mechanical testing will be conducted in load frames with the ability to test in various environments such as oxidizing and steam. Strain will be monitored by high temperature extensometers and digital image correlation. Damage will be monitored and assessed using acoustic emission technique which will help determine conditions for inducing damage in samples prior to applying the repair technology. The well-equipped labs and relevant experience in ceramic processing, repair, mechanical testing, and environmental exposure provides a good chance for success, rapid progress, and requires no new capabilities.  

CMCs enable more efficient turbine engines for reducing fuel consumption, carbon emissions and environmental impacts due to their higher operating temperatures, reduced cooling requirements, and improved engine efficiency. Successful repair methods will further enhance the green technology benefits of CMCs by contributing to their greater utilization in turbine engines, longer component lives, and reduced costs and waste. 

Milestones 

Identify relevant types of SiC/SiC CMC damage, suitable repair materials, and processing approaches (12/2023). 

Develop compositions and processing conditions for repair materials to be applied to damaged SiC/SiC coupons (3/2024).  

Develop a silicon carbide fiber reinforced patch repair method for larger flaws (6/2024). 

Evaluate repaired and unrepaired composites under relevant mechanical stresses and environmental conditions (9/2024).   

The work will be evaluated based on the ability to retain the mechanical properties and environmental durability in the repaired CMC compared to the performance of the unrepaired CMC. Success will be achieved if there is significant improvement in the usability of the repaired CMC. Monotonic tensile tests will be performed at room or high temperature on repaired and unrepaired CMCs to quantify the enhancement in strength provided by CMC repair technology. Additionally, stress rupture testing of repaired and non-repaired CMC test coupons in a steam rig under a constant or cyclic load until failure will be conducted. Next, the times to failure will be compared for as-fabricated, repaired, and non-repaired SiC/SiC tensile specimens to identify the improvement in CMC life and reusability provided by the implemented CMC repair technology. 

If the repair of SiC/SiC activity is successful, the next steps are to further increase the technology readiness level (TRL). Composite repair could be progressed toward an actual SiC/SiC turbine engine component. Repair of a complex geometry could be addressed as well as integrating the reapplication or repair of an EBC coating. For patch repairs with woven SiC cloth, fiber coatings can be integrated for enhanced mechanical properties. Also, for repairs over CMC components with film cooling holes, the reintroduction of cooling holes can be demonstrated.  

The CMC repair technology can be transferred to engine companies. Also, there are transition opportunities for ground-based power generation. There may be opportunities to collaborate with NASA aeronautics projects or engine companies which are testing or are already using CMC components. The repair of their tested and in-service parts could be demonstrated.  

With our past experiences and lab capabilities, we stand a good chance of developing SiC/SiC CMC repair technology and believe we have made a fair assessment of the feasibility. However, if the method was determined to be non-feasible, we could quickly pivot our activities. If there was an issue with material or processing compatibility, we could adjust our approach to be better matched with SiC/SiC materials. If the whole approach is not feasible and needs to be abandoned, we would pursue another necessary and relevant technology for CMCs. During the remaining months, joining and integration technologies could be pursued which allow for the buildup of larger and more complex shaped CMC parts as well as their incorporation with metal-based systems (e.g. support structures, blade roots and hubs, cooling manifolds, etc.). Our team has extensive experience in developing joining and integration technologies which can be leveraged here. Each joining approach must be tailored for its specific case based on material pairings (e.g. CMC to CMC or CMC to metal), joining interlayer approach (e.g. paste, foil, hybrid, and multi-layer), joining method (e.g. brazing, diffusion bonding, eutectic phase bonding, reactive slurry infiltration), part geometries, applications conditions (e.g. operating environment, temperature, and stress) and performance requirements. A narrowed focus could be to demonstrate the feasibility of a brazing approach for the case of brazing a SiC/SiC CMC blade root to a metallic rotor hub.

Title: Performance Enhancement of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Components with Machine Learning for Electric Aircraft Propulsion 

Description of the work  

NASA aeronautics goals include pioneering new technology to reduce emissions, noise, and carbon footprint from air travel.  The feasibility of using fuel cells and on-board cryogenic hydrogen (H2) systems in combination with electric motors for zero emission commercial transport aircraft has been widely examined.  Developing a practical, implementable carbon-free electric power system for a highly constrained “electric aircraft” application is a complex and complicated poly-dimensional optimization problem. The primary factor limiting fuel cell implementation remains thermal management at the required high fuel cell stack specific power levels resulting from inadequate heat transfer and unacceptably inefficient operation manifesting as low average cell voltage (Vcc). Despite many historical and current research efforts by government, academia, and aviation industry, the relative importance of design parameters across multiple systems and levels of assembly remains poorly understood.  Materials science and engineering has played a central role in the evolution of improved electrochemical technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. However, traditional ‘‘Edisonian’’ approaches to evolve from discovery to commercial implementation is too costly and time consuming relative to the accelerating anthropogenic climate change resulting from Carbon Cycle disruptions. The emergence of Machine Learning (ML) modeling methods with increasingly powerful computers has augmented cross-disciplinary technological advances from materials discovery to commercialized products.  This activity proposes using the latest artificial intelligence (AI) research to develop two ML models. the first model is critical to understand the relationships among system-level variables for electric aircraft propulsion (EAP) by assessing fuel cell power system response (Vcc) to the normalized aircraft electrical load current density (i) (

). The second model will implement a self-driven approach based on the first model and leverage existing models to elucidate the critical supporting parameters for optimizing the fuel cell system operation and calculate the EAP fuel cell power system performance metrics of power density (W/L), specific power (W/kg) and long-term stability (

) from repeated experimentation.  Establishing a self-driving laboratory for a ML fuel cell technology modeling tool marks a pioneering leap in sustainable energy research which sets it apart from traditional modeling methodologies like Monte Carlo modeling. This information will focus objective development goals by identifying material, components and/or system interfaces that can viably meet EAP performance metrics and provide feasible performance profiles for aircraft-level models investigating EAP. These sensitive parameters potentially can range from fuel cell component materials, mechanisms to enhance convective heat transfer, to low mass phase change materials, to optimizing power management and distribution (PMAD) components for reducing ohmic resistance. The study is a general development of a tool of FC for implementing EAP in the medium-scale commercial aircraft as it provides the most impactful transformation to zero emission commercial aviation.

Anticipated milestones and Performance Metrics 

Figure 1 illustrates the proposed iterative project workflow required to develop and train the ML model within the self-driving laboratory and conduct the statistical data evaluation for producing feasible and actionable data products of system sensitivity parameters influencing cell voltage response (Vcc) to the power demanded by the aircraft when assessed in electrical current density (i in mA/cm2). The five-(5) project milestones are shown in a GANTT chart in Figure 2. 

Figure 1: Schematic of Project Work Plan 

The work starts with collecting relevant PEM FC performance data, especially those for vehicle and aircraft propulsion, to develop the ML training data sets. Where the statistical evaluation determines that data gaps exist, synthetic data will be generated based on first-principal models. In parallel, the first ML tool element will develop a precise machine learning model that can predict the voltage response of the fuel cell system to the vehicle electrical load demand. Through preliminary statistical work, model building, and feature engineering, this first element will provide valuable insights into system variables and the relative relationship among these variables. While Monte Carlo models are valuable for probabilistic analysis and estimating outcomes within well-defined distributions, self-driving AI/ML labs offer a superior approach. The most influential ML tool element will drive NASA software in a self-driven lab for closing any gaps between the fuel cell system performance metrics and aircraft performance requirements. These labs are equipped to autonomously conduct experiments, adapt to changing conditions, and continuously learn from data. By harnessing machine learning and AI, they minimize the potential for errors and inefficiencies associated with human intervention. This innovative approach aligns with the vision of Industry 4.0, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies reshapes manufacturing and research processes (Abolhasani et al., 2019). Furthermore, the self-driving lab seamlessly integrates with our software to drive tools toward achievable desired outputs. This symbiotic relationship enhances fuel cell performance, ultimately advancing the frontiers of sustainable energy research and development. Any deficiencies in the resulting specific power, power density, and performance stability then guide development objectives to improve FC power and propulsion system performance.  

This effort will produce six-(6) deliverables: a preliminary EAP requirements set, a ML modeling tool consisting of two elements, a preliminary PEM fuel cell model performance set, Data Gap Closure Resource Estimate, a ML model Validation Resource Estimate, and a final report.

Follow-on Activities 

The products of this foundational work would be integrated into existing aircraft-level models for developing electric aircraft and accelerate the development of the FC power and propulsion systems. Learning more about the relationships between system variables (features or input) will focus future research on the technologies limiting this application. In the next phase of this work, a significant experimental data collection is anticipated in order to replace the synthetic data by empirical data to validate and improve the ML model fidelity. Should these products become sufficiently mature, it remains feasible to incorporated them into an eventual Digital Twin model architecture.  

PI Scenario 

This scenario does not apply to this process as ML modeling is inherently an iterative process that utilizes the “fail early, fail often, but always fail forward” (J.C. Maxwell) approach. The ML model matures with each iteration and provides valuable insights into the poly-dimensional space under investigation. There exist multiple tools that can be used should one fail and there exists a great deal of data to mine that could be temporarily supported by synthetic data until credible empirical data became available. Implementing FC power and propulsion systems in a carbon-free electric aircraft includes many challenges available for ML modeling. There are many components, sub-systems, and interfaces that require additional performance data and development prior to integrating into an electric aircraft. Should resources become available, conducting experiments to close any identified data gaps would improve data quality.  ",,,,,,,,,

Formation flying is a well-known approach for improving the efficiency of flight. Migratory birds flying in V-formation gain significant efficiency by taking advantage of the upwash from the wing tip of the leading bird, which allows the trailing birds to fly with reduced angle-of-attack and lower induced drag [1]. For birds and aircraft alike, the key to gaining maximum efficiency with this technique is identifying the optimal configuration of the formation. While birds can do this adaptively in actual flight (and millions of years of evolution), computational tools are needed to investigate the possible benefits for safely improving the efficiency of human air transportation especially for use of newly emerging electric-Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle designs. 

The computational objectives needed for a comprehensive study of formation flight are: 

Finding the optimal formation configuration as function of vehicle types/design and flight conditions, 

Identifying the most efficient (and safe) way to form the configuration, 

and maneuver within the formation, e.g., to transfer the lead-aircraft 

potentially with specialized actuators for control within the wake where traditional actuators (e.g., ailerons) lose effectiveness. 

A study of the control laws to 

automatically hold the optimal configuration, 

while remaining robust to adverse weather disturbances, 

Determining methods to maneuver the overall formation as one,  

and compute optimal trajectories of the formation in weather. 

 

The concept of formation flight is not new and has been studied extensively. Some theoretical studies have shown potential drag reduction for extended formation flight at 38%-45%, and flight tests with more conventional vehicle types (F/A 18 and C-17) at AFRC have shown fuel flow reduction of 7%-18% [2].  Flight dynamics in wake is not necessarily LTI (linear time invariant) but is nonlinear LTV (linear time varying) [3].  The efficiency gains from free lift associated with formation flight may be offset by degradation in stability and control.  Safety and ride quality are important considerations.  The uncertainty around the trade-space for eVTOL vehicles is exactly why this type of work needs to be funded initially at a small funding level.  Because of the nature of the challenges in many different areas (nonlinear aerodynamics, nonlinear LTV flight dynamics, and nonlinear control), this is a rich area for research.  There are computational models for wake interaction currently under development [4] which could be utilized in this study to enable rapid assessment and trade-space exploration. 

 

There are however few (if any) studies on optimization of formation flight for more efficient Urban Air Mobility operations with eVTOL vehicles. Also, the simultaneous considerations of control robustness and formation safety are missing from all the studies that we know of. Traditionally, flight safety is concerned with wake avoidance, whereas the objective here is to leverage it for energy savings.

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

In the seedling effort, a sandbox demonstration case will be developed for a formation of three UAM Lift+Cruise reference design vehicles (already available from collaborative work with the RVLT project). The problem will be analyzed computationally to determine optimal vehicle configuration (distance and orientation of vehicles to each-other) in a cruise flight-condition for maximum range given a total energy constraint. Initial models for the formation in the cruise condition (with additional states for aerodynamic interactions) will be developed and analyzed from a robust control perspective to gauge the feasibility for safe operations with adverse weather (simulated using a gust and Dryden turbulence models). The final results are intended to inform the creation of new formation flight-based sustainability technical challenges within TTT.

Analyzing the overall safety of formation flight and, especially, convincing the FAA, will be the most difficult part. Further investigation will be required into vehicle technologies for detecting failures in advance and the ability to break formation safely when adverse events occur. Developing the computational technology (and leveraging existing solutions) required to address all of the aforementioned objectives could form the basis for a new technical challenge within the TTT project, one that simultaneously explores the aerodynamics, vehicle design, and robust fault-tolerant control required to realize the full benefit of formation flight for sustainable aviation.

If initial results show insufficient benefit, pivoting to consideration of vehicle design for increasing the benefit of formation flight is a possibility. This might include the design of wing-tip modifications, use of variable camber flaps, or even the optimized design of a specialized unmanned lead vehicle that allows passenger carrying vehicles to fly behind it with maximized efficiency.

Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric Propulsion,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT
FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL
Title: Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric
Propulsion
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits).
Problem: NASA is committed to supporting the U.S. climate goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions from the aviation sector by 2050 and is leading federal agencies and industry to
accelerate the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This includes developing and
deploying alternate, new vehicle designs and architectures including Hybrid Electric or All Electric
vehicle concepts [1,2]. Examples are the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (SUSAN) Electrofan, the Singleaisle Turboelectric AiRCraft with Aft Boundary Layer propulsor (STARC-ABL), and other activities
[3,4,5].
However, these aircraft concepts introduce new hardware systems along with new health
management challenges. For example, fault detection and diagnostics of hybrid electric or all
electric propulsion systems requires an understanding of the operation, performance, degradation,
and failure mechanisms of electric machines, converters (inverters/rectifiers), and power cables
along with the operation of these devices in increasingly complex flight environments [6].
Introduction of new vehicle types and integrated power and propulsion systems requires
increasingly intelligent vehicle systems with capability to detect, diagnose, and predict system
degradation, faults, and failures in a resilient and trustworthy manner. Furthermore, intelligent
vehicle systems must be capable of estimating system capability as it degrades. Monitoring the
system health state has an impact on system operating cost, performance, efficiency, and
environmental impact. Predictive maintenance reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time
through reduced unnecessary maintenance costs and improved vehicle availability and throughput.
Efforts are ongoing to evaluate and document potential failure modes and hazards posed by an
Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) system [6]. Due to their increased complexity and integrated
nature, EAP systems present additional failure modes and hazards not found in conventional
aircraft propulsion designs. Mitigation of these EAP failures requires a system-level design and
analysis approach, which is on-going. Major findings of this work include that EAP degradation,
faults, and failure modes present new health management challenges. This requires background
understanding of electrical engineering and system control and concept of operations (motor
control, generator control, battery management systems). Furthermore, electrical systems don’t
always degrade/fail gracefully, which makes early (timely) diagnosis to enable maintenance
challenging.
Faults include those associated with: electric machines (motors/generators) such as the health of
bearings, lubrication and cooling, windings, rotor, insulation; converters (inverters/rectifiers),
electronic components and the cooling system; high voltage wire and cables, including short or
open circuits and insulation breakdown; overall power quality including degradation/faults leading
to voltage ripple and power instabilities; and thermal management system and battery failures
(thermal runaway). These types of faults require new sensor measurement types compared to
turbine engine, e.g., concentrating on current and voltage, and tailored for a new infrastructure
associated with EAP rather than turbine engines. Although these faults are being identified in 
System Analysis and Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FEMCA) studies presently
ongoing in the ARMD [7], there is limited ongoing work related to understanding the sensor types
and sensing approaches most optimized for this new aircraft infrastructure. Such an understanding
is a necessary first step toward Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM), combining sensing,
diagnostics, and prognostics, for future Sustainable Aviation based on EAP.
Objectives: This task will work in parallel with the ongoing analysis of EAP fault detection [6,7] to
examine sensors and sensor systems that can address fault detection in EAP aircraft. The challenges
for sensor technology for EAP applications include: operation in a high noise environment or with
corona discharge at altitude; increasing integration of sensor technology into electric components
to minimize size weight power and cost; multi parameter measurements to better understand the
health state of the EAP system; providing actionable information for higher level diagnostics; and
leveraging the EAP architecture itself to provide better system level diagnostics. This task intends to
formulate a framework for sensor and sensors systems for EAP health management applications
addressing these challenges.
Approach: In particular, this task will examine the EAP architecture and fault studies to first
understand the wide range of potential failure mechanisms. It will then survey the existing methods
of EAP fault detection to both understand how it is done now, and shortfalls to these approaches. It
will then examine methods for improved EAP sensing including, e.g., new sensor types or additive
manufacturing. The conclusion of this work is a white paper summarizing the above activities and a
preliminary road map for possible ARMD future investment in this area.
This task leverages the ongoing activities in the Intelligent Control and Autonomy Branch (LCC) and
related existing expertise and capabilities [7]. Coordination between multiple sensor Subject Matter
Experts (SME) within the Communications and Intelligent Systems Division, as well as SME in other
Branches both at NASA Glenn Research Center and across the agency is planned. At least one trip is
planned given available resources to a relevant conference related to this topic and/or industry to
broaden the input provided to this study.
Although not presently proposed, but could considered with project management, is the possibility
of hosting a Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) on the topic Sensor Technology for EAP Health
Management, or even more broadly for IVHM for Sustainable EAP Aviation.
Anticipated Benefits: This task performs the initial survey work needed to define a sensor approach
to be combined with both on-going and future ARMD activities in IVHM for EAP applications
program in sensing, diagnostics, and prognostics. IVHM for EAP is necessary for eventual system
application, whether it be for safety, economic, efficiency, or performance reasons. Overall, new
electric vehicles can be smarter, safer, and more efficient leveraging the difference in architecture;
this work is a first step in providing sensor technology to enable this vision.
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.
Milestone Date
Project Initiation 11/6/23
Documentation of EAP Identified Fault Mechanisms (On-going Project) 12/6/23
Survey of Present EAP Fault Detection Approaches 3/30/24
Evaluation of Potential Alternate EAP Sensor Architectures 7/30/24
Summary Whitepaper and Draft Roadmap for EAP Sensor Development 9/1/24
This project should be evaluated upon whether a core understanding of the challenges of sensor
detection in EAP systems has been clearly articulated, and potential approaches for future work
coupling both sensors and diagnostics for EAP sustainable aviation have been reasonably identified
for future program implementation potentially in FY25. It is also expected that coordination with
other organizations related to, e.g., structural diagnostics or sustainable aviation prognostics, will
be ongoing.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential
areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
The need for IVHM for Sustainable Aviation has been introduced to ARMD project management
with positive response. In particular, it is our understanding that TTT Management has
acknowledged the importance of this area and expressed interest for potential future funding.
Assuming no project funding in FY24, this proposed project matures an understanding of the field
and establishes a framework for a more expansive IVHM development in FY 25 if chosen by project
management.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three
months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed
approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you
pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
Sensor development for health management of EAP systems is one component of what is necessary
for possible sustainable aviation. An equally challenging area is health management for hydrogen
powered vehicles especially those using cryogenic hydrogen. A NASA workshop identified a wide
range of challenges associated with converting from conventional hydrocarbon fuel systems to
hydrogen-based systems [8]. These include a significant range of safety concerns associated with
hydrogen leakage, seals degradation, or structural embrittlement. If a change of direction is decided
related to defining sensor technology for EAP applications, transition of the task to another aspect
of sustainable aviation, hydrogen powered vehicles, would also have a significant impact on
understanding the potential of IVHM for sustainable aviation.

Additive Manufacturing of Polyimde Composites for Battery Packaging,TTT Green Aviation,,"Additive Manufacturing of Polyimde Composites for Battery Packaging 

Introduction  

Advances in lithium battery has made electrical propulsion a reality in the electrified aircrafts. Lightweight aluminum has been used preferentially chosen as the packaging material due to the large amount of power require to propel the electrified aircrafts.  the weight saving in engines often translates into 3 times of weight saving in the aircrafts, it is imperative to find alternative materials for battery packs other than aluminum. Additive manufacturing of lightweight, high temperature thermoset polyimide matrix composites (PMC) in place of aluminum casing for battery packaging will save 50% weight (Al:PMC density ratio = 2.7:1.3 g/cc), ease the manufacturing process of complex shape and improve production efficiency. Furthermore, the boron nitride filled polyimide composite is thermally conductive but not electrically conductive, which may be a plus for battery packs to prevent the loss of electricity.  

 

Update on Additive Manufacturing (AM) of Polyimide Composites by Principal Investigator (PI) 

Traditional Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) uses the extruded thermoplastic polymer filaments by melting the filaments to carry out the 3D printing following CAD files.  Conventional laser sintering (LS) is another 3D printing technique that builds 3D objects layer by layer using laser to selectively melt cross-section of a powdered thermoplastic polymers.  However, the resultant 3D objects are often weaker in their strength due to the lack of polymer inter-chain connection in the z-direction; thus, limiting their use temperature to ~200°C based on the commercial thermoplastic polymers. 

 

Previously this PI has developed a melt-processable thermoset polyimide RTM370 resin powder, which can be subjected to laser sintering (LS) at 180°C to build a 3D “Green” object, and subsequently post-cured at 371°C in an oven to fully crosslink the reactive terminal groups within the resin into a network with a glass transition temperature (Tg, softening temperature) of 370°C. A high temperature thermoset polyimide carbon fiber composite bracket with >300 °C capability was additively manufactured by laser sintering (LS) for the 1st time in collaboration with U. of Louisville and funded by the Air Force during 2016-2018.

Recently the PI has also demonstrated the feasibility of 3D-printing composite specimens with boron nitride 

(BN) filled RTM385-SLS polyimide resin powder by laser sintering to afford “Green” dogbone specimens, which was subsequently post-cured at 343°C to afford a 3-dimensional network of BN-polyimide composites with a Tg of 395°C and a thermal conductivity of 0.7 W/m-K with a 6-7%  porocity ─ a major accomplishent under TTT and AATT funding.  Therefore, it is feassible to 3D-print thermally conductive but electrically insulating battery packs by laser sintering, using BN-filled thermoset polyimide resins.

 Objective and Innovation of This Proposal: An Improved Fused Powder Fabrication (FPF) 

Although PI’s previous advance in the state-of-the art of laser sintering of thermoset polyimides with boron nitride fillers has certainly made additive manufacturing of thermally conductive, but electrically insulating battery packs an attainable goal. However, the required use of vast area of powder bed in laser sintering creates a large amount of unused resin powder in the peripheral surrounding the desirable object.  It is the objective of this proposal to initiate a Fused Powder Fabrication (FPF) of melt-processable BN-filled thermoset polyimide that will print the actual 3D object directly very similar to Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) using thermoplastic filaments.  1) This fused thermoset polyimide powder fabrication approach will save cost on the valuable resin powder, and 2) the use of thermoset resin powder which can be further post-cure the as-printed “Green” object to achieve a higher use temperature than the commercial thermoplastic filaments can achieve.  It also eleminate the cost of extruding of filaments for FFF. 

2) Project Plan 

Using melt-processable thermoset polyimide resin powder, PI will collaborate with Hyrel 3D printing company to design a prototype Fused Powder 3D Printing Head that is capable of attaching to the existing commercial Hyrel 3D printer at GRC.  The goals are 1) demonstrate the capability of printing prototype 3D objects; such as square or dogbone-shaped tensile specimens. 2) print a prototype battery pack with high temperature of >300°C capability.

3) Strategic Alignment: 

Battery packaging fits into STMD “Live” framework of human life support, advanced materials/structures/manufacturing. It also fits into GRC’s Power and Energy Storage focus area. Battery packaging is the critical safety requirement for the success of power supply in space and electrified aircraft in aeronautic propulsion on Earth. The packaging materials typically prefer to be multifunctional; they must provide the necessary thermal and safety performance without significantly increasing the mass of the pack. Furthermore, additive manufacturing is an essential thrust in both STMD and GRC strategies. 

    Technology Readiness and Taxonomy: 

       Starting TRL:  2   Target End TRL:  3 

        Primary TX:  Additive manufacturing of polymer composites fits into 

                              TX.12.2.1 Advanced Materials, Structures and Manufacturing.   

        Secondary TX: Battery components fit into TX.03.2.3  Aerospace Power and Energy Storage .  

 

Technology Infusion or Transition Plan: 

● When an additively manufactured composite battery pack is built, it will be transfer to Photovoltaic 

    Electrochemical Systems Branch (LEX) for evaluation in certain existing programs for space  

    power and electrified aircraft applications.   

● GRC’s RTM imide resins are already licensed to Imitec Inc. as a commercial product, and a patent has  

    been filed in 2019 for the said laser sintering technology to make high temperature thermoset  

    composites with >300 ̊ C capability.  

● This same technology of fused powder fabrication of melt-processable thermoset polyimide composites 

    can also be used to build the Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) for reentry as these polyimide resin  

    have shown to have higher char yield than the state-or-the-art of phenolics. 

 

4) Contingency Project Plan: 

In a hypothetical instance that the proposed fused powder fabrication (FPF) method was not successfully in demonstrating the technology advance after 4-month of trying, the team always has a fall back plan of 3D-printing the battery packs by laser sintering of RTM385-SLS polyimide resin with h-BN fillers, which has demonstrated its feasibility in the introduction section of this proposal.

Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title: < Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks > 

     Cryogenic hydrogen fueled aircraft (under development at NASA GRC, Airbus, etc.) is one of the options to slash CO2 emissions related to air transportation. The main issue with using hydrogen in aircraft is its very low density [1]. Storing hydrogen in its liquid state (at cryogenic temperature) is one of the methods to increase the density. Liquid hydrogen storage tank needs to be resistant to hydrogen embrittlement and capable of structurally withstanding the temperatures of liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement is a reduction in the ductility of the structural material (metal alloy) due to absorbed hydrogen. The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of hydrogen absorption on ductility of the alloy GRX-810 [2], that is under development at NASA GRC. GRX-810 is a new breakthrough 3D-printable alloy with remarkable high temperature properties, e.g., creep. It is an oxide dispersion-strengthened alloy with a Ni-Co-Cr matrix. Preliminary tests of this alloy at cryogenic temperatures also show promising results (Yield Strength (YS) T®77K ~ 0.9 GPa, Elongation to Failure (EF), or ductility T®77K ~ 40%). We note that recently developed Ni-Co-Cr-based Medium Entropy Alloys (MEAs) in general demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures, e.g., a remarkable increase in strength accompanied by a simultaneous increase in ductility (YS T®77K ~ 0.7 GPa, EF T®77K ~ 90%, FT T®77K ~ 280 MPa×m1/2), with decreasing deformation temperature from Room Temperature (RT) to cryogenic temperatures [3]. The diffusivity of hydrogen (e.g., along the grain boundaries), its segregation at lattice defects and the corresponding effects on deformation behavior (e.g., ductility) have not been quantified in the literature for Ni-Co-Cr-based MEAs, in general, and GRX-810 alloy, in particular. Atomistic modeling and simulations are perfectly suited to study the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement in full atomic detail and provide recommendations for novel alloy compositions that improve deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures. Our proposed effort will be leveraged by the capabilities we already have. In particular, the Density Functional Theory- (DFT) informed simulation potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group, will be used for this project, along with the state-of-the-art atomistic simulation techniques (including ab-initio, molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo, and their combinations) [4, 5]. 

      

     First, we will fit the interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr-H (using the existent interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group), to enable realistic modeling of hydrogen diffusion and segregation at lattice defects in the material. Next, the segregation of hydrogen at lattice defects (e.g., grain boundaries) will be investigated, employing hybrid Molecular Dynamics / kinetic Monte Carlo (MD/MC) simulations. And finally, the effects of hydrogen segregation on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures will be studied. In particular, a series of MD deformation tests will be carried out at cryogenic temperatures, varying the amount of hydrogen (and the amounts individual Ni, Co, Cr elements) in the simulation system containing a lattice defect, which would serve as a sink for hydrogen (e.g., a grain boundary). The successful accomplishment of the proposed work will lead to identifying the composition that most effectively improves the performance of the material at cryogenic temperatures. 

     The anticipated milestones will include the following:  

ab initio calculations for the H energetics in the Ni-Co-Cr alloys. 

Interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr-H, suitable for simulation of hydrogen diffusion in the Ni-Co-Cr alloys. 

Effects of hydrogen, segregated at a lattice defect (e.g., grain boundary) on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures. 

Effects of Ni-Co-Cr composition (by varying the amount of individual Ni, Co, Cr elements in the simulation system) on the above behavior. 

 

     In the next step we will study the behavior of the composite system, containing hard oxide (Y2O3) particles embedded in the Ni-Co-Cr-based matrix, under deformation at cryogenic temperature. The interface between the oxide particle and Ni-Co-Cr-based matrix will possibly serve as a sink for the absorbed hydrogen. The effects of hydrogen segregation at this interface on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures will be studied, as well as the effects of solute atoms segregating at the interface on the above processes will be investigated and recommendations will be made regarding solute additions that maximally improve the deformation behavior.  

     Dedicated experiments will be carried out at NASA GRC to test the theoretically obtained results. If successful, the proposed project will enable a number of new Air/Space applications for the GRX-810 alloy, e.g., as a structural material for cryogenic liquid hydrogen storage tanks (liquid hydrogen-fueled aircraft technology: under development at NASA GRC, etc.). 

 

     The results of MD/MC simulations heavily depend on the quality of interatomic potential. Our initial choice is the Finnis-Sinclair semi-empirical potentials which are the computationally cheapest reasonable interatomic potentials for metals. However, if we find that this type of potential cannot reproduce our ab initio data obtained within first 3 months, we will switch to machine learning (ML) potentials.

"Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for Aircraft Structures",TTT Green Aviation,,"Title: Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for
Aircraft Structures.
Background: Industry enthusiasm around thermoplastic composites (TPCs) is seeing a
resurgence due to the potential for rapid manufacture of large aerospace structures. TPC
matrices differ from the traditionally utilized thermosetting resins in that fabrication of a
thermoplastic (TP) part requires only heating the material above its softening temperature and
applying pressure to consolidate multiple layers of material. Currently, this process requires
consolidation in a press or autoclave. The autoclave process for TPs has a substantial energy
requirement for heating and cooling (processing temperatures are higher for TPs than
thermosets) and autoclave/press consolidation requires non-reusable, consumable materials.
However, opportunity for manufacturing flexibility exists for TPs because the requirement for
consolidating thermoplastics includes only heat and pressure. Of particular interest is out-ofautoclave consolidation.
Problem: Out-of-autoclave or ‘in-situ’ consolidation eliminates the energy intensive
processing step of autoclave or press consolidation. To date, mechanical tests on parts
manufactured by this process have shown a reduction in interlaminar strength. Previous work
at the University of Delaware studied the physical mechanisms controlling laminate quality
during in-situ consolidation by automated fiber placement (AFP). Process variables such as heat
transfer, inter-ply contact time, and void reduction were modeled, tested, and quantified. The
causes of inadequate consolidation were correlated with process, material, and machine
parameters. The study concluded that heat transfer, lay-down speed, and consolidation
pressure were the principle controllable process variables affecting laminate quality. (1,2)
Current AFP and braiding processes do not support the time, temperature or pressure
requirements to allow single-step production of aerospace quality composites.
Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Out-of-autoclave processes have been
attempted and is an area of active research but, to date, has been unsuccessful in meeting the
mechanical properties achievable by traditional processing methods. The issue is partly due to
time, temperature, and pressure requirements as described above. However, this cannot be
the entire story as well-established fusion bonding processes such as induction welding and
ultrasonic welding are very rapid in nature and still yield strong bonds. The fundamental
difference between these welding processes and in-situ consolidation is in the number of
heating and cooling cycles experienced per ply of the TPC during fabrication and consolidation.
When carbon fiber/thermoplastic plies are consolidated the air trapped between those layers is
condensed by the consolidation pressure and absorbed in the matrix. In-situ consolidation by
AFP, for example heats every ply as it is laid down, and several plies beneath. Each time a layer
is reheated, trapped air expands, eventually leading to interlaminar void formation and reduced
interlaminar mechanical properties.
Where did they go wrong/what is different about this approach: There is evidence to suggest
that the issue with current approaches is related to the repeated heating and cooling of 
consecutive plies during laminate fabrication. Work supported through a GRC 2022 Center
Innovation Fund (CIF) has demonstrated that at least 8 plies of a braided preform can be
successfully consolidated in one step by an induction welding approach, with dynamic crush
properties comparable to autoclave consolidated parts.(3) Induction welding is a common
thermoplastic joining technique and is effective for consolidating a braided composite
architecture. Here we propose exploring ultrasonic welding as well, which provides a lower
cost alternative and greater composite design flexibility than the induction welding process. A
New Technology Report was submitted for this manufacturing approach within the NASA GRC
NTR system and the work will be presented at the CAMX conference in Atlanta, GA.
1. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon
completion. We propose a building block approach to demonstrate this technology with
the success metric including (1) laminate consolidation and (2) interlaminar mechanical
properties that are comparable to press or autoclave processed composites.
a. Literature and market survey to assess full environmental impact of in-situ
consolidation.
b. Establish in-house capability for in-situ consolidation.
c. Coupon/Subcomponent Coupon Data: apply building block approach to verify
that consolidation and strength metrics can be met with single-step
consolidation processes. This includes in-situ consolidation and mechanical tests.
d. Budget: Costs for this project are associated with materials, manufacturing, and
test. This includes a contract for welding (out of autoclave consolidation) while
concurrently building the capability in-house. Previous work at GRC has
demonstrated out of autoclave consolidation with induction welding. In this
activity we would like to explore other options.
2. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the
potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? This work will
establish feasibility of the material class to enable sustainable aviation through reduced
energy manufacturing costs. Next steps include but are not limited to the following.
a. Evaluate feasibility through consolidation of a representative structure, i.e.,
variable thickness and diameter.
b. Manufacture braided subscale fuselage and wings. Explore opportunity to
leverage the AFRL DMAAPS (Design for Manufacture of Attritable Aircraft Primary
Structure) program. In this program the AFRL manufactured a braided fuselage
and wings of a small, UAM size aircraft with an out of autoclave thermosetting
epoxy. Using their tool and design for manufacturing would allow direct
comparison to cost, time, energy savings and consolidation quality of our process
with that of a state-of-the-art material and process.
Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three
months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial 
proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining,
how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
c. Fusion welding is a well-established process for joining thermoplastic composite
parts. The novelty and risk associated with this proposal is using the fusion
welding processes for consolidation purposes. In the event this is not technically
feasible the project can pivot to documenting the strength and stiffness knockdown inherent to in-situ consolidation with the understanding that the
applications may be acceptable for attritable aircraft and/or unmanned vehicles.

Title: High Lift High Load LPT Blade Design for Hybrid Turbine Engines
Problem Statement
Hybrid electric aircraft concepts, in general, offer the potential to downsize the core design of turbine engines, a
concept currently under examination in the HyTEC program. Additionally, they provide operational benefits
influenced by developments through TTT initiative. Both endeavors aim to enhance the efficiency of turbine engine
components while increasing the overall bypass ratio of the aircraft. It is important to acknowledge that there are
inevitable challenges associated with the downsizing of engine components, which must be addressed. While
HyTEC focuses on promptly finding solutions to these challenges for near future, it is imperative to remain mindful
of and proactively tackle the technical difficulties that might affect such efforts for the long term. On the other
hand, new aircraft concepts like SUSAN and STARC-ABL aim to hybridize aircraft operations by employing turbine
engines to power electric machines, thus further increasing the aircraft's overall bypass ratio. In order fully unlock
the potential advantages offered by these conceptual aircraft architectures, it is imperative to comprehend and
address the challenges and potential enhancements that will impact the turbine engine. In the turbine engine, high
pressure, and low-pressure turbines (HPT and LPT) are responsible for providing the energy to run the high
pressure and low-pressure compressors (HPC and LPC) respectively as well as providing excess energy for auxiliary
components of the aircraft. the significance of the turbines, particularly the LPT, should not be underestimated
1
.
Understanding the flow physics in LPT is vital and presents a significant challenge, leading to an intricate design
process. On one hand, the LPT must perform optimally in high Reynolds number (𝑅𝑒) condition near sea level
where maximum loading is required for take-off. On the other hand, the majority of the flight time is spent at high
altitude cruise condition where the air density results in a lower 𝑅𝑒 and lower momentum flow in LPT section2
.
Low-𝑅𝑒 conditions can be particularly troublesome, as the lower momentum flow is prone to separation and
transition effects due to the adverse pressure gradient experienced on the suction surface of the blade. Off-design
operating conditions in the LPT section result in performance degradation due to this flow separation. This
phenomenon known as Reynolds lapse3
can be intensified as the LPT gets smaller due to the smaller core of the
future engines. Also, concepts seeking burning Hydrogen as a fuel will decrease 𝑅𝑒 more and contributing to such
losses even further.
Multiple research efforts have addressed Reynolds lapse in LPTs with the most recent one conducted by air force
research laboratory4
through optimal design of high lift high, high load low pressure turbine blades. All the current
and previous works in this field seek to optimize the design of turbine blades in the traditional setting of gas
turbine engines. The proposed work here seeks to utilize the design work conducted through TTT in Operability
Influenced Design (OID) to investigate the possibility of understanding the design space for high-load high-lift LPT
blades for hybrid electric engines. OID currently focuses on redesigning HPC component of a typical gas turbine
engine by realizing the possible benefits of addition of electric motors to the engine enabled by Turbine Electrified
Energy Management (TEEM) concept.
Through this design practice it became evident that high-load blade design and optimization of turbine and
compressor blades is required to fully realize any possible benefits which can be enabled by such control concepts
or use of novel fuels such as hydrogen. Investigating such design spaces requires utilizing tools to allow for correct
estimation of the flow field and flow transition that occurs at low-𝑅𝑒 in LPT. NASA currently lacks such crucial tools 
and thus is incapable of conducting thorough analysis on the blade design to investigate correct benefits of these
technologies on the engine components. OID mostly benefits the design of the compressor section which is tied to
LPT and HPT closely. Moreover, there are similarities in the design process which can be translated from the
turbine section to the compressor section.
This work will to investigate the feasibility of designing high-load high-lift LPT blades for hybrid-electric aircrafts in
cooperation with air force research laboratory through a one-year effort. Through this design process, significant
expertise and blade design capability will be transferred to NASA work force.
Approach
The work will be divided in three phases with each contributing to a milestone.
Milestone 1 [2 months from actual start date (AS)]: The requirements for the LPT blade design will be identified
using a NASA 𝐸
3
engine as a relevant open system which can be applied to both NASA OID effort and power
extraction technical challenge under HyTEC. This milestone will be completed by defining the loading at each stage
of the LPT according to a high lift, high load blade design approach. This milestone will be completed by providing a
detailed requirements for each blade row of the 𝐸
3
LPT. The substantial volume of data accessible for this engine
design guarantees a high level of confidence in achieving this milestone.
Milestone 2 [10 months from AS]: The first stage LPT blade design space will be explored based on the
requirements identified in milestone 1. Turbine Design and Analysis System (TDAAS) will be used in this effort. It is
a tool currently utilized by air force research laboratory to perform similar type of analysis for traditional turbine
engines. TDAAS uses an airfoil generator along with a grid generator and flow solver to build the workflow for
blade design. The various first stage LPT blade designs generated through this system will be evaluated
aerodynamically first along with physical buildability. This milestone will be completed by designing the first stage
blades for a hybrid-electric high-lift high-load LPT. In the event that we do not fully attain this milestone, it will
provide us with a deeper understanding of the technical hurdles associated with LPT design necessitated by a
reduction in the engine core size. This, in turn, will guide us in pinpointing areas for future research focus.
Nevertheless, as a positive outcome, NASA stands to gain valuable expertise in blade design and optimization,
which will prove indispensable for numerous ongoing research initiatives, including but not limited to addressing
power extraction technical challenge in the HyTEC project, OID, SUSAN, and endeavors related to thermal
management for energy extraction from the engine core.
Milestone 3 [12 months from AS]: The blade design achieved in milestone 2 will inform the researchers on the
feasibility of the high lift, high load blade design for the other four stages of the LPT. While a thorough redesign of
the blades is required to accurately assess any possible benefits in LPT, it will not be in the scope of this work.
However, analytical methods can be utilized to estimate such benefits and investigate the possibility of reducing
the stages in this LPT. This milestone will provide an analysis of the overall benefits to the LPT design through the
analysis of the engine system with a redesigned LPT in NPSS. If Milestone 2 is successfully accomplished, this task
can be carried out using analytical methods based on the principles of turbomachinery design. However, if the
second milestone is only partially achieved or not completed, it will provide valuable insights into the system-level
constraints when designing high-load LPTs. This, in turn, will enhance the realism of evaluating new aircraft or
engine concepts.
Upon its successful conclusion, this endeavor will primarily enable NASA to acquire the knowledge and resources
essential for in-depth blade design of turbine engine components. While initially the licenses for software in this 
effort should be purchased, it is the goal of this work to subsequently integrate these methodologies with NASA's
internal tools, including NPSS, OTAC, FUN3D, and others, to empower researchers in the design or redesign of
turbomachinery blades. This approach will facilitate the development of innovative conceptual architectures and
the tools required to effectively evaluate potential advantages stemming from new technologies. Furthermore,
this work will offer valuable insights for the OID and SUSAN projects, as well as forthcoming projects focused on
the assessment of new fuels and engine concepts.
Special Scenario
""If it proves unfeasible to design new high-lift, high-load blades, the project can easily shift its focus towards the
redesign of the compressor within the OID work. This effort aimed to develop a new HPC design for the 𝐸
3
by
leveraging the advantages of adding electric machines to the engine. In this context, the ongoing work can
reallocate its resources to delve deeper into the aforementioned effort, exploring the redesign of one or multiple
stages within the new HPC concept. While the primary goal of this effort is to attain expertise and tools for blade
design, it will still contribute to the project's success.

Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft - a path to zero emissions,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL
Title: Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft – a path to zero emissions
1. The work will build upon the dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept first demonstrated
in 1956 to enable a path to low emissions, which reduced demands on renewable energy and
infrastructure, towards zero emissions. The dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept retains the
wing tanks and economically adds hydrogen to a 737-class single aisle offloading Jet A to retain
the same range enabling flexible aircraft operations and paths forward. Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel
aircraft with only 2080km of zero emission range, or 30% hydrogen by energy can reduce
emissions by 50% can be raised to an astonishing 97.5% at lower and more stable fuel costs
than SAF and Jet A. The low energy per unit volume of hydrogen introduces significant aviation
challenges for 100% LH2 fueled aircraft to economically meet the stringent mass, volume, and
safety requirements and the first order optimum is ~30% LH2 by energy. The 97.5% U.S.
emissions reduction will require a change in the airline business model.
The dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept is a significant departure from the 2021 U.S. Aviation
Climate Action Plan based on drop-in carbon-based Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and most
importantly, is not a ‘farther term technology” that also retains the current Aero portfolio to
offset increases in cost. The U.S. Climate Action Plan stated that there was no expectation that
LH2 aircraft would make a significant contribution towards achieving net-zero emissions by
2050. The much slower adoption of hydrogen fuel was also based primarily upon the need to
access renewable energy and to develop ground storage and distribution systems, and to a
lesser extent, upon the need mature electric and hydrogen technologies and to tackle several
other technical and safety challenges. The 2020 European Hydrogen Aircraft study cited a
derived need for ~4300GW for 100% SAF vs 1450 GW for 100% LH2--likely overlooked--while
30% LH2 would require 435 GW, a ten-fold decrease, but must add back liquefaction energy. By
relying on off-grid and excess energy, LH2 production will not have to rely on grid provided
renewable energy. Note that plant based SAF may only achieve 25% carbon emission
reduction, ~4X less than carbon free hydrogen and SAF via direct air capture.
At present, 2050 SAF goals are unstainable beyond ‘not achieving the net-zero by 2050
goal’. In general, limited supply SAF (HEFA) is the lowest cost while unbounded supply based on
direct air capture [a massive green prize] plus green LH2 (PtL/e-kerosene) is the highest cost
fuel. SAF’s have predicted costs 2-10x the cost of Jet A, creating a significant risk to national
and world security, in an attempt to limit aircraft and infrastructure modifications, besides
incorrectly assuming SAF would require less renewable energy and that off-grid, excess
renewable energy is not available, which would favor hydrogen.
The U.S. Climate Action Plan correctly identified that Aviation *must change the fuel* to
meet net zero goals and that technology alone showcased in the in EPFD and TTBW/X-66A
demonstrators would *not* be sufficient. In *contrast*, hydrogen aircraft would become the
pull technology in fewer higher energy locations to help eliminate grid bottlenecks and reduce
emissions in the hard to decarbonize industries. In contrast, rather than remove fuselage and
engines from a MD-90 to form the TTBW/X66A, adding hydrogen tanks could fly the same
number of PAX with hydrogen plumbed to the rear-mounted engines. The Airbus A380 LH2
demonstrator adds a 3rd hydrogen engine cantilevered from the fuselage along with the
hydrogen fuel system and tank. In contrast, while the truss braced wing is an excellent design
for battery and 100% hydrogen aircraft since ~no energy will be carried in the wings, the lower
amount of jet fuel carried must be further considered in a dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept.
In the proposed work, hydrogen must be approached from a systems level, because it
won’t work unless you have all the pieces to make it work from an operating system. Since
hydrogen production results from off-grid and/or excess renewable energy, dual fuel does not
have to be dependent on grid green energy and wait 30 years. Conversely, objectives are
achieved when a bottoms-up understanding of the assumptions, physics, and resources
including those outside NASA’s domain are tracked, compared, and traded versus
vehicle/system goals requiring proper communication/insight, including what happens when
projects are not priorities or technology risks are not properly identified, and subsystems are
not compatible. Safety cannot be assessed without integrated designs and hardware. Indeed,
many others recognize one must limit the need for renewable energy and potential
infrastructure buildup and dual fuel enables aircraft flexibility across the globe while
significantly reducing emissions economically. UH: “Boeing and Airbus are likely to develop a
replacement for these venerable models (single aisles dominated by the B737 and A320) for
entry into service in the mid-2030s. The only way aviation can meet Paris Agreement emissions
targets is if the new single aisle airplanes are hydrogen powered.” “A hydrogen single aisle
does not need to be a radical new design” an unstretched MD-90 or a ‘Transatlantic Concept’
flying the same number of PAX as a A320 needs to be examined, as well as adding the
unducted fan/ultra-high-bypass engine, to name but a few paths to explore.
A 100% hydrogen powered aircraft increases fuel volume over four-fold versus a
conventional aircraft occupying cargo and passenger space, while 30% hydrogen by energy can
provide 50 to 97.5% reduction in emissions via 2080km of zero emissions range to tackle the
easy part of the range sooner and more economically with 9 times less energy than ekerosine/Power-to-Liquid (plus liquefaction energy) at 2 to 10 times less cost than SAF.
The dual fuel concept--ready for short term demonstrations as there are no insurmountable
problems--opens up the design space for further out technologies including those beyond NASA
and all of the areas identified in this Green Aviation New work: Alternative Propulsion, Aircraft
Design, Materials and Manufacturing, Air Traffic Management, Emission Control, Sustainable
Infrastructure, and Contrail Formation requiring $100Ms not $M.
Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel aircraft with 14% hydrogen by weight can reduce emissions safely
by 50 to 97.5% to supplement SAF reductions at less costs, and more importantly, will reduce
demands on renewable energy and infrastructure. The work will perform studies of the dual 
hydrogen-jet fuel concepts and many key components, describe key SAF challenges and
limitations, outline the pathways, challenges, and infrastructure changes for dual fuel aircraft
and technologies to speed the transition safely and economically to beyond net zero.
2. The work will further examine the strengths and weaknesses of the dual fuel concept to
reduce emissions by 50% sooner and more economically than SAF within the time frame of the
award and resources provided. Benefits and opportunities for dual hydrogen-jet fuel electric
propulsion will be described. The milestone is to provide sufficient justification that leads to a
demonstration path or to be unlikely usurped by alternative approaches. Many innovative
design details and the 97.5% justification are not described due to proposal limits but will be
further developed as bottoms up design is required for system assessments, to address safety.
3. The limited resource Green Aviation New Work is only a path to zero emissions which
will require $Bs to place aircraft into service, identify the limitations and hence opportunities
for further R&D in an expanded design space that transcends NASA—a significant effort beyond
the PI abilities to raise the TRL. Before this work is completed, NASA could outsource the same
work to a University Led Initiative, add a task to the Truss Braced Wing Demonstrator, have
another organization help develop a key technology( e.g., tanks), or collaborate further with
other agencies to develop the infrastructure, to name just a few.
4. If the concepts are not technically feasible, it then creates the opportunity to examine
or ignore alternatives and/or breakdown current approach to the key challenges likely
presenting opportunities to other disciplines. Proposal constraints prevents addressing many
detailed design issues. Innovation occurs when folks presented with a problem ask, ‘how may
we look at this differently’. How one pivots depends on many factors, but especially on how
complete the current approach was examined. With so many areas to investigate listed above,
it will require a re-examination of the path forward to first expand and then contract the trade
space with data. Another factor is that SMEs are not always correct, and often do not present
limitations clearly, so it’s important to understand the rationale for this assessment, especially
if new data/methods and/or a breakthrough overcomes the limitation.
In the case of dual fuel, the most obvious alternative approach is SAF via DAC that becomes
sustainable or funded by DOD for National Security, which is only a small fraction of NASA
domain, so this is a limited opportunity. A logical pivot would be toward technology to reduce
fuel burn to reduce resources required for zero emissions. The pivot would have to make an
impact since there are no rewards for failure in a very mature and challenging industry since
the story being told in general is that one shifts to line or project management. Further
developing AI, propulsion, electrical, materials, and other discipline and technology skills almost
always help develop paths forward so will also be included in the pivot options-perhaps better
than let the team understand that path forward is unlikely.",,,,,,,,,

Title: Computational Design of Superconductors for Superconducting Aircraft Propulsion Motors
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you
solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go
wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this
problem before, why not? How does your proposed work transform current capabilities,
tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work
enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references/citations to back up claims
where appropriate.
All electric airflights offer climate-neutral aviation by greatly reducing carbon emission [1]. However, the
traditional electric motor is limited by its power density, i.e., the power to weight ratio. Superconducting
aircraft propulsion motors have the potential of achieving power densities 2-3 times the state of the art for
machines in the megawatt (MW) or larger class with > 99% efficiency [2]. This requires superconductors
to carry very strong current, and therefore, the superconductor coils [3,4] must be kept well below its
superconducting critical temperature. Currently, the high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs), in
particular, cuprates (such as GdBa2Cu3O7 films) [5] are used in such motors and must be cooled to below
20 K by liquid hydrogen, although their critical temperatures are well above 77 K, the boiling point of
nitrogen. However, liquid hydrogen is not only expensive but also poses a substantial risk to safety.
Previous researches in this field have been focused on designing new structures of the superconducting
motors while employing the existing cuprate HTSCs. Though this approach has led to operational
superconducting motors with much improved energy to weight ratio compared with the traditional ones,
the target MW and larger class are still beyond reach without considering new superconductors which can
carry stronger current and/or at higher temperatures. Such researches on new superconductors require
totally different technical expertise than what the engineering groups working on this filed usually have.
In this project, we propose to computationally design novel superconductors, in addition to current
researches on designing novel motor structures. The combination of these two approaches has the potential
of reaching the desired energy density at a much higher output power scale. Furthermore, previous
theoretical researches [6] on superconductors have been mostly dedicated on predicting the critical
temperatures �!, and very few efforts [7,8] have been spent to consider and calculate the critical current
density as a function of temperature and to find out superconductors with higher critical current. 
Technically, the critical current density �(�) has the same temperature dependence as that of the
superconducting gap amplitude Δ(�), and Δ(�) can be obtained theoretically by solving the coupled
integration equations for superconducting and total charge densities, respectively, which are a direct
consequence of the well-known mean-field BCS theory [9]. To obtain �(�) and Δ(�), firstly, one has to
calculate the critical temperature �!, which depends on a number of physical quantities according to the
BCS relation and the McMillan’s analysis [10]:
�! = �
1.45 exp /− 1 + �
� − �∗(1 + 0.62�)
7
#.%&
.
Here � is the Debye temperature, �∗ the Coulomb repulsion, and � the electron-phonon coupling constant.
These three key quantities are also needed to obtain the parameters in the coupled integration equations.
We note that nowadays �, �∗ and � can be computed by solving the quantum mechanical equations (first-
-principles electronic structure calculations) routinely and accurately, and the calculated �! based on the
above McMillian’s expression can be quantitatively comparable with the measured data. Thus, a
breakthrough has been made in superconductivity research, and one prominent example is the experimental
discoveries of the high-T superconductor SH3 under high pressure after the first-principles calculations
were carried out. In 2014, Duan et al. [11] predicted �! of 200 K under a pressure of 160-200 GPa for SH3,
while in 2015 Drozdov et al. [12] measured �! of 203 K under 160 GPa.
Besides first-principles calculations, machine learning and data mining [13] have been successfully applied
to find new superconductors and to determine their �! [14]. Our group members have employed, tailored
and developed both first-principles and high-throughput computational tools to compute lattice vibrations
(phonons) and electron-phonon coupling in metals and insulators. These tools can be used to accurately
evaluate �, �∗ and � and to fast screen materials by efficiently estimating these quantities. Furthermore,
our group members have used machine learning and data mining methods to study battery materials and
biomaterials, and this expertise is directly transferrable for superconductor research.
Superconductivity research requires close collaborations
between theory and experiments since theory alone or
experiments alone are prone to errors and false claims
[15,16]. Our experimental collaborator, Prof. Chen in
University of Houston, is a world-renowned expert on
HTSC and topological superconductors [17-19].
Combining our theory/computation and their materials
synthesis and characterization will be the key for us to
find out superconductors which can carry stronger
electric current at higher T for making aircraft motors.
As summarized in Figure 1 on the right, there exist five
different types of superconductors forming more than
12,000 known superconductors listed in the SuperCon
database [20]. Guided by the existing data, known
empirical rules and experimental observations, we will
employ the high-throughput screening and machine
learning and data mining to find out potential candidates.
Then we will apply the accurate first-principles methods
to compute �' and �(�) for these materials. Finally, our
theoretical findings of the most promising candidates will
be synthesized and measured by our experimental collaborators.
Fig. 1: The major advances in superconductivity vs year [6].
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.
During the first year of the work, we will focus solely on employing, developing, and examining firstprinciples methods to calculate the superconducting critical temperature �! and the critical current density
�(�). As mentioned previously, methods to compute the associated crucial physical quantities of �, �∗ and
� have been implemented in many popular first-principles programs such as VASP [21] and ABINIT [22],
but we need to program the code to solve the coupled integration equations to obtain the superconducting
gap amplitude, Δ(�), and then �(�). However, reaching the desired accuracy for �∗ and � is still very
challenging, since multiple approximations are involved and we need to carefully examine these
approximate models and numerical convergence for different types of superconductors. Some existing
models need to be further improved or simplified to increase accuracy or efficiency so that these quantities
can be calculated within certain tolerable errors and reasonable computation cost.
The anticipated milestones are the errors in the calculated critical current and critical temperature are
within 50% and 25%, respectively, compared with experimental data for a few prototypical superconductors
belonging to five different types as illustrated in Figure 1, with particular emphasis on calculating and
comparing critical current for superconductors currently used in superconducting aircraft motors.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the
potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
After this work is finished, we shall possess the computational capabilities of accurately evaluating the
critical current density in different types of superconductors from first principles. Next, we will employ and
develop the high-throughput tools to compute these quantities, so that we can do fast screening among the
existing 12,000 superconductors and novel possible compositions. The machine learning and data mining
methods will also be built and tested, as an alternative approach to find out potential candidates for further
theoretical investigations using the first-principles methods. Then we will combine these computational
approaches with experimental measurements to find out either existing or new superconductors, which can
carry twice of the maximum current the present HTSC films can do and/or which can carry the same
maximum current as before at temperatures higher than 77 K. Twice of maximum current would increase
the output power density of the aircraft motors by 300%.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three
months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial
proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining,
how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
After three months into this work, if we find that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically,
we will first identify the cause. The approach based on first-principles calculations that we described in the
first session has been implemented in many codes and has been tested for numerous superconductors with
varying degrees of accuracy on the calculated �!. Large errors in �! normally means that the calculated �,
�∗ and � are not sufficiently accurate, which will also severely affect the accuracy in the predicted �(�),
when solving the coupled integration equations.
The Deby temperature � normally can be predicted very accurately, while the Coulomb repulsion �∗ and
electron-phonon coupling constant � are much harder to be obtained with sufficient accuracy. We will (1)
examine and improve the theoretical models and numerical convergence; (2) use machine learning and data
mining techniques to obtain these two values from the SuperCon database and other existing theoretical
results and measured data; (3) employ phenomenological models, which are based on physics
considerations, but whose parameters are often fitted to measured data.

Title: Enhanced Aerogel Composites for Lithium-Ion Battery Performance Safety and Efficiency (ECLIPSE) 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

Concern over climate change has created an opportunity and need to target new aircraft technologies for the next generation of single-aisle airliners which account for greater than 50% of worldwide aviation emissions. NASA Projects such as the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) and the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) are tasked with the development of technology and designs for aircraft to meet greener low emission objectives and enable a new generation of electric-powered aircraft. Within the electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) technologies under EPFD, higher efficiency batteries are of significant interest. Over the past few decades, battery technologies have seen exceptional advancement, however, thermal control and thermal runaway continues to be a challenge.  To combat this issue, an advanced material with phase change capability is necessary to absorb or redirect thermal energy during normal operation and protect cells from the extreme heat produced during a thermal runaway event. One such potential material is a Phase Change-Polymer Aerogel Composite (PCPAC), which will offer the advantages of a typical aerogel such as extremely low density (~ 0.1 g/cm3),1 high porosity (> 95%),2 high specific surface area (500–1,000 m2/g),3 and mechanical strength4. 

 
 
Current methods for thermal management and thermal runaway prevention impose a significant weight penalty. Current assumptions when designing an energy storage system for electric aircraft state that 30% of the overall mass of the system is the packaging of the batteries, which includes the methods of thermal management and thermal runaway propagation prevention. To achieve a realistic solution for electrified aircraft, 400 Watt hours/kilogram (Wh/kg) at the battery module level is the minimum energy density limit. Current Lithium-Ion cells have an energy density of up to 250 Wh/kg, giving an energy density of 175 Wh/kg at the battery module. As energy densities at the battery cell level increase, the weight penalty will remain, and possibly even increase based on the advanced cell chemistry characteristics.   Aluminum is mainly used as a thermal and physical barrier between cells and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3. Replacing some of the aluminum used for packaging with a low-density aerogel (0.1 g/cm3) will allow for substantial weight savings and a decreased percentage of parasitic mass for the battery module while also acting as an effective thermal management material and a lightweight barrier to thermal runaway propagation. 
 

In this study we will demonstrate a new approach to 3D printing polyimide aerogel composites with phase change material capability using the facile, cost-effective process of direct ink writing (DIW) without the need for extreme conditions or additional post-processing steps. This will be accomplished by using a dual-head syringe to print the high temperature resistant polymer aerogel in combination with the target temperature polymer to infiltrate the pores whereby the aerogel acts as a host system for the phase change material. Expanding access to non-moldable complex structures via 3D printing will enable aerogels to insulate more complex arrangements of electronic components. Looking forward, the use of custom-fit aerogels for lightweight thermal insulation of batteries can facilitate electric vehicle and electric aviation applications.

INFUSION: 

Applications such as Solid-state batteries are particularly promising due to their wide temperature stability resulting from the removal of volatile organic liquid electrolytes. However, lower room-temperature ionic conductivity and poor interfacial contact currently limits the use of solid-state electrolytes for high performance applications. These limitations can be mitigated by increasing the operating temperature, thus increasing the ionic conductivity. As such, the ability to maintain high temperature throughout operation is critical for harnessing solid-state batteries for electric aviation, and lightweight, custom-fit aerogel insulators have potential to address this concern. This application has direct correlation with TTT Convergent Aeronautic Solutions’ projects Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety for Electric Aircraft (SABERS) and Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD). The successful outcome of this proposed work would directly impact commercial electrified aircraft as well as have significant interest to other mission directorates such as SMD and STMD.  

Project Viability 

In the event that the viability of this material does not meet our key performance parameters early on, the possibilities of using alternative chemistries are vast. The structure of the polyimide aerogel that will house the phase change material has been demonstrated through a suite of patents which lends to a high level of confidence for its success. The phase change material can be made from a myriad of chemistries targeting various temperatures. The intention is to perform an optimization study for just this purpose. The study will easily shift to different methods of synthesis or 3D printing if needed.  ",,,,,,,,,
Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title: Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft
1. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) recently published their updated Strategic
Implementation Plan which calls for increasing focus on sustainable aviation and achieving net-zero CO2
emissions by 2050. Alternative propulsion is an area of specific interest, and one method involves
hydrogen fuel cells. Through NASA’s ongoing Commercially-viable Hydrogen Aircraft for Reduction of
Greenhouse Emissions (CH2ARGE) project, this technology is thoroughly being assessed through different
aircraft design cycles. This project focuses on medium range aircraft with around 180 passengers and a
range of about 2,500 nmi, which falls into the category of short-medium range aircraft that generate about
two-thirds of the CO2 emissions generated by this industryi
.
There are different types of fuel cells, but the basic idea is that by reacting both hydrogen and oxygen gas,
one can produce power with water and heat as byproducts; therefore, if designed properly, the aircraft
can be a net-zero CO2 emitter. A significant obstacle to adopting fuel cells as a power source for aircraft is
that the thermal management system (TMS) must handle multiple challenges. A benefit of fuel cells is
that they are ~50 %, which is higher than the ~30 % efficiency of the traditional jet engine cycle. However,
unlike traditional aircraft, the hot gases generated by the propulsion system don’t just exit through the
back of the engine; rather, in fuel cell systems, the heat is contained in the fuel cell stack and must be
conducted out and either dissipated or put to good use supporting a secondary system. This becomes
problematic as the propulsion system for a mid-size aircraft will require 20 – 25 MW of power, meaning
that the fuel cells will be producing about 10 MW of heat. Ample consideration must also be given to the
quality of heat generated, since heat dissipation to the surroundings becomes more difficult and complex
as the ambient air becomes warmer.
Another significant challenge is that the aircraft’s high energy-dense hydrogen fuel has cryogenic needs
to be operationally feasible. The design of a relevant TMS would require significant consideration for
hydrogen boil-off, refrigeration, insulation, and others, since all are nontrivial technical challenges that
will substantially impact the TMS design. However, the potential a cryogenic hydrogen fuel offers is also
promising, as this opens multiple design paths not offered in traditional aircraft. For example, the TMS
could leverage any boil-off from the tank to condition or further cool critical aircraft components and
potentially open the doors towards super-conducting applications.
All the above are complex problems that must be addressed for net-zero CO2 emissions in aviation to be
successful, which is why it is important that NASA address this problem now. We have conducted a survey
on the different TMS used by various NASA-funded internal and academic projects of similar electrical
scaleii, iii, iv, vand have found the above issues to be consistent challenges facing the industry with increasing
electrification. Promising technologies that would enable a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft include using
oscillating heat pipe spreaders on the aircraft skin vi
, using liquid hydrogen flow loops to cool
componentsvii
, and using thermal storage devicesviii in conjunction with more traditional pumped-fluid
loopsix
.
Despite the many technologies mentioned above, the design of the TMS has consistently been found to
be a major area requiring development that lacks the appropriate priority in the design cycle of aircraft –
it is consistently an afterthought that results in severe performance penalties. With increasing
electrification, the TMS system must now be designed in-tandem with other major systems to develop a
viable aircraft system. To efficiently design a hydrogen aircraft's TMS, we propose developing a novel
design tool that will integrate TMS design with the design of the electrical power system and the
cryogenic hydrogen storage system. This tool will serve as a framework upon which different sizing and 
analysis tools, such as the in-house developed Electrical Power System – Sizing and Analysis Tool (EPSSAT)
x
, will be integrated to enable the iterative co-design of the TMS, power management and distribution
(PMAD) system, and cryogenic system architectures. The flexibility enabled by this tool will allow for the
quick sizing of components while also providing estimates on important performance parameters such as
TMS mass, volume, area required, drag and power penalties for mid-size aircraft, which to the best of
knowledge has not been done before.
This tool will enable us to conduct a trade study on aircraft fuel cell systems operating in two different
temperature regimes: under 100 oC and between 100 - 200 oC. These temperature ranges correspond to
low temperature PEM, a more mature technology, and high temperature PEM, still in the development
phase, fuel cell technology. The trade study will identify and evaluate various TMS architectures and
interfaces, identify design drivers and technology gaps, and identify bounds and industry standards that
will guide the TMS design. Our analysis will identify high priority test cases for each temperature range
with a focus on system mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements. In addition, it will also be used
to inform a more targeted investigation into more effective technologies for cooling large fuel cell stacks.
Our team is proposing to investigate several enabling technologies that could benefit hydrogen fuel cell
aircraft, such as: outer-mold line cooling enabled by oscillating heat pipes; using high-conductivity heat
spreaders; using passive components like conventional heat pipes; using phase-change materials to
handle transients; storing heat in the fuel, and using the product water from the fuel cell as a heat sink.
The balance of plant components, including the cryogenic fuel storage and conditioning system, and the
PMAD system will also be evaluated to provide a more realistic understanding of the TMS.
2. The milestones from this work result in a final deliverable of a TMS level design tool for low and high
temperature PEM fuel cell hydrogen aircraft. We will deliver two completed TMS trade studies for fuel
cells operating in the temperature ranges mentioned above. This will provide NASA with an understanding
of what fuel cell operating temperature range is most promising with regard to the TMS and allow us to
identify components that will require further development. These milestones are described in detail
below:
The first milestone will be to define the design space and to identify and gather standards that will guide
the design of a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft TMS. We will identify and baseline a mission profile and identify
a range of environmental conditions that a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft will experience under both nominal
and off-nominal conditions. Major components and interfaces within the TMS will subsequently be
identified, with operational limits defined to bound the design space. [Completed Month 2]
The second milestone is to develop system-level models of the TMS, PMAD, and cryogenic storage
systems for a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft. As a result of there being two different fuel cell ranges in this
proposal, there will subsequently be two different TMS designed and evaluated to span the operational
temperature ranges. It follows that each model will determine how heat is extracted and transported
from each aircraft component, and then ultimately rejected to the surrounding air. Enabling technologies
identified from our survey and other literature willsubsequently be subjected to the intense trade studies
that follow from this design cycle. Ultimately, this will result in optimal configurations for each TMS. Both
the PMAD and cryogenic models will be generated through collaboration with the CH2ARGE project,
where efforts are already being made to design and interface these systems through existing tools such
as EPS-SAT, which was created and used in other NASA aircraft projects. [Completed Month 9]
The third milestone is to evaluate the two different TMS developed in milestone 2 and subject them to a
baseline mission profile and nominal/off nominal conditions and provide estimates on parameters
important to a larger aircraft study. These parameters will include mass, parasitic power, and the TMS
efficiency. A significant outcome of this effort will be the identification of design drivers and technology 
gaps that must be addressed to make hydrogen aircraft feasible. Therefore, potential critical components
will be identified and assigned performance requirements to be enabling technologies for hydrogen fuel
cell aircraft. [Completed Month 12]
3. There are many possible paths for follow-on research upon completion of this project. A major goal of this
study is to identify technology gaps and uncertainties for fuel cell-based propulsion systems. This could
include exploring different fuel cell materials and stack designs, deep dives into various TMS and
components, detailed investigation of components within the cryogenic fluids management system, or
the need to further explore innovative cycle architectures. Some potential next steps are described below:
High Fidelity Modeling and Experimentation – experimental prototyping of promising technologies. This
effort would involve a detailed investigation of critical components that require cooling. One example is
the fuel cell as this is a limiting component that not only generates large amounts of heat, but also has
difficulty in having this heat removed. Potential technologies from literature have pointed towards
invasive technologies, such as heat pipes, to efficiently move this heat out; however, this is a
multidisciplinary effort that would require collaboration with fuel cell experts to properly assess
performance penalties. Resulting designs from a dedicated high-fidelity model would then logically move
into a prototyping stage for eventual experimentation.
Performance of additive heat exchangers at cryogenic temperatures - many of the advances in heat
exchanger technology are made possible through additive manufacturing. However, there are very few
studies into how the alloys used in additive manufacturing behave at cryogenic temperatures. The
durability and life of these components is unknown and needs to be investigated.
4. While it is unlikely the actual approach to modeling the TMS will fail, it is possible that the designs won’t
be able to close due to mass, power, or volume constraints. In this situation we will move onto identifying
technology gaps and placing bounds and requirements on enabling technologies. We will also identify
testing that needs to be done on existing components to understand expected performance under the
aircraft operating conditions.

Title: Commoditization of molecular simulation data for exploration of new aerospace  polymers 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references/citations to back up claims where appropriate.  

 

This work proposes to commoditize molecular polymer models by: (1) automating the development of models and their characterization data analysis and (2) developing standard methods allowing models to be compared more easily.  

 

The materials available to design aircraft have a large impact on the capabilities of the aircraft and can be used to define the eras of flight – wood and canvas, aluminum, titanium, fiber reinforced polymer, etc. Traditionally, new materials development is a long-lead and expensive part of new aircraft design. The advent of computational modeling new materials has the potential to advance the efficiency of new material development to accelerate the insertion of new materials to meet challenging aviation goals. For example, non-petroleum derived polymers, polymers for lightweight composites, and low-energy curing polymers can decrease the environmental impact of an aircraft lifecycle. 

 

For state-of-the-art fiber reinforced composite systems, the axial properties are dominated by the fiber, and the purpose of the polymer is to facilitate load transfer between fibers. Properties that depend on this load transfer and therefore on the polymer include fracture toughness, transverse, and shear properties. Improving these properties can reduce the weight of the structure or new non-petroleum-based polymers could be used if their performance can match those of existing polymers. 

 

The problem we are proposing to address is the speed and cost of modeling new polymer materials. Many relevant properties of polymer materials originate from the molecular structure of the polymer and can be predicted using molecular dynamics simulation. However, molecular dynamics models can be time consuming to build and develop, which typically limits in-depth analysis to single polymer systems. Developing new polymers, however, requires screening of many different candidate systems. The individually customized modeling procedures currently in use have costs (time and effort) beyond what is required to generate a large database of properties or to rapidly screen new chemistries. Furthermore, machine learning and other emerging data analysis methods are predicated on the availability of large quantities of reasonably curated data.  

 

There are commercial packages with polymer modeling capabilities, such as the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, Materials Square, and Materials Studio. These are typically wrappers that use the capabilities of open-source molecular dynamics codes and their engine. Often the focus of these commercial packages is “democratizing” molecular models, so the emphasis is on a graphical user interface. The goal of this project though, is to involve as little or no human intervention. Some packages have scripting capabilities, but the user would be required to write the software that performs the automation negating the benefits of the commercial package. 

 

One of the requirements of developing a database of simulation material properties is a set of standardized procedures used to create the polymers and characterize them. For experimental materials, there are standards such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) that allow for comparison of material properties. For molecular models, research groups tend to have their own methods, which vary in ways that may or may not be consequential. To overcome the challenge of standard and repeatable results of molecular models of polymers, what is being proposed is method development to establish standard procedures for computationally guided selection of material properties. 

 

To these ends we are proposing: (1) automation of the generation of molecular models of polymer systems and the characterization of the resulting systems, such that new systems can be rapidly screened and (2) standardization (versioning) of molecular simulation procedures, so the resulting predictions are repeatable and comparable.  

 

 

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

 

Milestone 1: Determination of modeling procedures and system sizes for select material properties. 

Outcomes: Baseline standards for select material properties. Select properties are expected to include crosslink density, mass density, glass transition temperature, Young’s modulus, and may be expanded to include area-under-the-curve toughness, yield strength and other molecular-scale properties. Preliminary polymer systems would include well characterized systems such as epoxy-amine systems and homopolymerized epoxy systems, which are used to validate the procedures and work through the automation steps.  

 

Milestone 2: Estimate compute resources required to generate specific database sizes, based on system size and runtime requirements obtained from milestone 1. 

Outcomes: Estimate the average system sizes required and simulation runtimes required to obtain the select properties from Milestone 1. This data is used to determine database sizes that can be modeled (0.1K, 1K, 10K polymers etc.). 

 

Milestone 3: Identification of workflow steps that require automation and document software requirements for each step. 

Outcomes: A roadmap of the software requirements that need to be developed. For example: what would be involved in automating the assignment of some popular molecular force fields, what would be required to automate the polymerization reaction chemistry definitions – which are required to build the models from their constituent monomers, automatic data analysis of the resulting models to determine the material properties, which currently involves some human intervention.  

 

Upon completion of the milestones the software requirements and compute resources to generate a database of material properties will be known. 

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

After completion of these milestones, the work may proceed to developing the software to automate the simulation workflows and generate a database of properties. Some automation has already been performed under the Hi-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing (HiCAM) and Game Changing Development (GCD) super-lightweight aerospace composites (SAC) projects, which resulted in databases for rapid curing resins and ionic liquid resins, respectively, on the order of tens of polymer systems being developed with reduced human intervention. Through this work it became apparent that there was a plausible path to fully automate the workflow. 

The suite of material properties that are predicted can also be expanded. As the standardized procedures mature and the database grows, data analysis can be performed on the data to identify potential polymers for new environmentally friendly aircraft structures. Multi-scale models that use the molecular dynamics models as input could be built to predict properties that originate at length-scales larger than is possible with molecular dynamics, like fracture toughness. The scope could also be expanded to include investigating requirements for high throughput experimental screening of polymer systems, including identification of chokepoints and estimation of resources required to generate experimental databases of various sizes. The experimental data may also overlap with the simulation data to aid in model validation.  

 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

If the compute resources required to generate a full database are beyond reason, methods to reduce the computational cost can be explored. For example, coarse-grain simulations could be developed. This adds complexity and development costs but could reduce compute resources. ",,,,,,,,,
Elastocaloric Cooling: The Missing Link in Green Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Transformational Tools & Technologies Project
FY24 Green Aviation Proposal

Title: Elastocaloric Cooling: The Missing Link in Green Aviation
1. Project Description, Background, and Motivation:
Elastocaloric materials are currently poised to serve as transformative and efficient solid-state
coolants relevant to TX14 Thermal Management Systems (TX14.2.1 Heat Acquisition and TX14.2.2 Heat
transport) in the 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy [1] but they have yet to be considered as a major
enabling element for Green Aviation. This year (2023), NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate
(AMRD) has published a strategic plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050,
whereby hydrogen fuel and other electronic power sources (batteries) are major contenders to replace
carbon-rich fossil fuels. To reach the objective of zero carbon emissions, several milestones must be
reached on a global scale including sourcing and transporting elemental hydrogen, developing hydrogen
combustion systems which burn hotter than fossil-fuels in traditional Brayton cycles [2], implementing
temperature sensitive high-efficiency batteries, and replacing electronics that exhibit losses from joule
heating [3]. Phase change materials (PCMs), such as paraffin wax and heat pipes, have been
implemented in prior studies to overcome these problems, yet their performance relies on specific
ambient conditions and an optimal geometric design for specific duty cycles. Thermal buffering is not
robust enough to keep pace with NASA’s decarbonization efforts. One major limiting factor common to
all these proposed carbon-free technologies (including nuclear) is the peak operating temperature.
Therefore, thermal control is of paramount importance to support the development of Green Aviation.
Current cooling methods rely heavily on vapor-compression technology, whereby, the latent heat of
vaporization of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) produces the cooling effect with which we are familiar. In
vapor form, these HFCs are greenhouse gases, and therefore cannot support the cooling of Green
Aviation systems. Accidental release of HFCs during the filling or catastrophic bursting of over-pressured
refrigerant lines is a major worldwide problem that contributes to global warming. Therefore, several
agencies and countries have supported the development of high-efficiency refrigeration technology free
of HFCs [4].
Elastocaloric materials offer a carbon-neutral solution to replacing HFCs and vapor-compression
refrigerators. In its simplest description, the elastocaloric effect (ECE) is defined as the temperature
change that occurs within a material when it is elastically deformed by a mechanical load.
Thermodynamically, all materials exhibit this behavior, but some, namely shape memory alloys (SMAs),
are capable of super-elastocaloric effects. These super-ECEs are characterized by adiabatic temperature
changes, ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑, of over 20°C and manifest from the latent heat of reversible martensitic phase
transformations [5] driven during superelasticity. Fortunately, SMAs are under current investigation at
NASA for aeronautical actuation, e.g., in vortex generators and aileron motion. Several of their
properties have been measured and stored in databases, and a unique feature of SMAs is their 2-way
thermomechanical coupling which enables their value as coolants. SMAs are energy converters and are
the archetypal candidates for super-ECE cooling systems [6].
In SMAs, reversible martensitic transformations are driven by mechanical stress, 𝜎, temperature (𝑇)
sweeps, and sometimes a magnetic field, 𝐻. If the transition takes place under a constant 𝜎, a large
shape change can be observed as indicated by the alloy’s strain, 𝜖 (superelasticity). 𝜎-driven changes in
heat capacity, 𝐶𝑝, serve as the backbone of the ECE, and in SMAs the latent heat of the reversible
martensitic phase transformation superimposes with the traditional ECE. Fig. 1(a) demonstrates the
large ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑 measured in a NiCoMnTi SMA which was measured to be ≈ ±18°C [7].
Recently, researchers in academia and industry are pushing to exploit super-elastocaloric
technology, but they often rely on bulky tension/compression instrumentation. The coefficient of
performance (COP) is determined based on both material properties and loading type, as shown in Fig.
1b. In Fig. 1b, SMAs subscripted with a “t” or “c” indicate tensile or compressive loading.

The PI believes that torsion may offer a better excitation mode whereby the mechanical advantage
of gears can be exploited to decrease the power needed to produce the desired ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑. Torsion designs
could enable the miniaturization of the excitation system and minimization of necessary power input.
This project focuses investigations in the “unknown” region labeled in Fig. 1b for materials with COPs
greater than 23 and ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑 greater than 20°C [6]. The development of miniature solid-state regenerators
could revolutionize Green Aviation by enabling better temperature control in zero-carbon emission
systems.

reported in Ref. [7], and (b) the ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑 corresponding to the ECE in commonly studied SMAs [6].
2. Plan and Anticipated Milestones:
The ECE is usually defined by the ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑 or isothermal entropy change, ∆𝑆(𝑇𝐾, 𝜎) =
1
𝜌∆𝑇𝑘
∫ (𝜖𝑇𝑘+1 −
𝜎
0
𝜖𝑇𝑘
)𝑑𝜎, where 𝜌 is mass density, 𝑇𝑘+1 and 𝑇𝑘 are test temperatures, 𝑇𝑘+1>𝑇𝑘, ∆𝑇𝑘 = (𝑇𝑘+1 − 𝑇𝑘) and
𝑇𝐾 = (𝑇𝑘+1 + 𝑇𝑘)/2 [8]. The ∆𝑆 is useful in determining the COP [8] shown in Fig. 1b, and prior work
has demonstrated that the COP of SMAs can be approximated by seven materials properties, namely the
transformation strain, 𝜖𝑡𝑟 , the reverse-transformation Clausius-Clapeyron slopes (slope of phase
diagram co-existence lines), 𝑑𝐴𝑓/𝑑𝜎 and 𝑑𝐴𝑠/𝑑𝜎, the austenite finish temperature, 𝐴𝑓, the martensite
start and finish temperatures, 𝑀𝑠 and 𝑀𝑓 respectively, and the 𝐶𝑝 of martensite. Some of these
parameters have already been measured in several SMAs at NASA Glenn Research Center and the PI
aims to perform bulk data analysis to identify promising compositions for ECE applications.
If funded, this project (Table 1) will result in at least one technical memorandum or journal article in
the first year and a path to design 2 novel SMAs. This project is defined by the 3 tasks listed below:
1. Review databased super-ECE data and the state-of-the-art with an emphasis in identifying
important and missing materials properties and determine if a COP above 25 is feasible with
∆𝑇𝑎𝑑> 20°C in SMAs.
2. Down select and assess both archetypal and novel binary/ternary SMA systems through
common synthesis and processing techniques (arc-melting/vacuum annealing), and characterize
properties at least via calorimetry (latent heat, 𝐶𝑝). The measurement of other characteristics
such as (𝜖𝑇, 𝜎, ∆𝑆, 𝑑𝜎/𝑑𝑇) with isothermal mechanical testing, and iso-stress heating/cooling
experiments will be attempted and potentially pursued with follow-on funding. Mechanical
testing and calorimetry will also be used to determine hysteresis loss.

3. Sustaining research beyond the award period:
The ECE is not specific to SMAs but is a thermodynamic feature of all physical matter. Moreover, the
caloric effects in matter are not limited to mechanically driven temperature changes. Instead, different
driving forces can be applied, including electric and magnetic fields to change temperatures in
electrocaloric and magnetocaloric effects (MCE), respectively. The ECE via tension and compression is
only one potential solution in solid-state cooling to support Green Aviation. Torsional modes should also
be investigated. Therefore, follow-up research and transition areas include studying other non-SMA
calorific materials, the MCE, and various loading modes. Specifically, the giant MCE has been under
scrupulous investigation in meta-magnetic shape memory alloys over the past few decades [8].
Additionally, this work can benefit NASA space missions, including the space technology research
grants, early state Innovations (ESI) and ARTEMIS by providing a method of extreme thermal
management. Other applications can include passive cooling of all electric aircraft motors.
4. Risk Mitigation:
In the hypothetical situation that my team of subject matter experts determines that the initial
proposed approach is not feasible, we will pivot by designing materials to overcome the obstacle. For
example, if some SMAs do not exhibit the necessary mechanical properties for several thousand cycles
of super-ECE loading, we will attempt to understand why and design a material with the needed
properties (strength, ductility, microstructure, etc.). The proposed project is low-risk and has the
potential for a high-yielding transformative technology to support Green Aviation.

Title: Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable?

We are proposing an unconventional compound backward-forward swept wing concept as shown.  

 

  

 

Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing Design 

 

The premise of this proposed concept is the potential gain in aerodynamic efficiency which could lead to reduced energy consumption [1]. This could be due to the increased lift as a result of the aeroelastic wash-in twist due to wing bending. This bending-induced lift is given by [2]

Description automatically generated 

where w is the vertical bending, y is the conventional pitch axis coordinate, and L is the elastic axis sweep angle, negative for forward-swept wing. The flow on the outboard forward swept wing is generally directed inward while the flow on the inboard backward swept wing is generally directed outward [1]. In the transition region, it is hypothesized that the flow would be largely streamwise, resulting in additional increased lift. The inward spanwise flow outboard tends to decrease the wing tip vortices, hence reducing the induced drag [1]. Appropriate geometric twist design can be incorporated to further reduce the wing tip vortices. 

 

Forward swept wing design has been tested on X-29 aircraft [3]. Advantages and disadvantages are well-documented [1]. Improved aerodynamic efficiency and high-angle-of-attack performance are known advantages of forward-swept wing design [1]. Stability and aeroelasticity (bending divergence) are known challenges with forward swept wing design which are generally viewed as major technical barriers [2,3]. A compound backward-forward swept wing could potentially be a transformative design since very little research has been done on this type of wing design. It is believed that the proposed concept would lessen these issues due to the inboard backward swept wing which would compensate for the adverse effects of the outboard forward swept wing, while potentially providing increased aerodynamic efficiency.

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

 

A tentative set of milestones are as follows: 

 

Month 1 - OML and structural model definition of a conventional backward swept wing and a few proposed wing with varying transition station and forward sweep angle for comparison 

Month 4 - Aero-structural performance tradeoff analysis to identify an aerodynamic efficient design using VSPAERO coupled to transonic small disturbance/integral boundary layer and finite-element model. 

Month 6 - CFD verification in FUN3D aeroelastic solver and comparison high-angle-of-attack performance of clean wing between the conventional and proposed design. 

Month 8 - Aeroelasticity and stability analysis in VSPAERO coupled to TSD/IBL and NASTRAN 

Month 10 - Verification of aeroelasticity and stability in FUN3D aeroelastic solver using forced oscillation simulation data 

Month 12 - Final report submission 

 

The metrics for evaluating the proposed work will assess improved L/D for the same structural weight and stability and aeroelasticity criteria which could be static pitch stability, bending-torsion divergence speed, or other criteria. Success criteria will be defined. 

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

 

If successful, the immediate next step would involve identifying a potential project (TTT, AATT) for transition and briefing to industry collaborators (e.g., Boeing).  The follow-on research would include: low-speed wind tunnel test at university facility (e.g. University of Washington), full aircraft configuration aerodynamic performance analysis, control surface modeling, FUN3D stability and control (S&C) simulation and analysis of full configuration, addressing design complexity and weight-drag tradeoff, high-lift design and performance, and aeroelastic tool development for rapid performance and S&C analysis of proposed concepts. 

 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

One potential scenario of pivoting from the initial proposed approach is to explore alternative approaches. The initial phase of work will involve performing design trade study between aerodynamics, stability, and aeroelasticity. This study may define alternative approaches in addition to initial preferred concepts. One alternative approach could be an actively controlled forward-swept wing tip design to provide limited L/D benefit and improved stall characteristics of the aileron in low-speed operations. Alternative concepts of passive stability augmentation could also be explored by modifying the design of the tail stabilator including the location. Another alternative approach could closely examine the role of structural interaction whereby aero-structural optimization would be performed to better reveal the potential benefit of the compound backward-forward-swept wing design. It is anticipated that further refinement of preferred concepts and alternative approaches could well take up a full year. ",,,,,,,,,
Integrating Bio-inspired Multifunctional Structures into QUiet Electric Engines (QUEEN),TTT Green Aviation,,"The electrification of engines for large single-aisle aircraft (~180 passengers) and integration of these engines onto novel airframes, such as the Subsonic Aft Engine (SUSAN) concept aircraft is a formidable challenge. To realize predicted performance benefits, these engines are more tightly integrated into the fuselages than in the past which implies more cooperation between engine and airframe manufacturers. New design and optimization tools are needed, as well as the data to validate these tools.  New aircraft will need to prove flightworthiness, and certification requirements are not yet established for these new configurations, posing financial and technical risks to manufacturers. Since there are international regulations on aircraft noise and emissions, formulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) Working Group and adopted by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, cleaner and quieter aircraft have a competitive advantage in the global market.  

How will a large electric aircraft take-off and land safely, cleanly, and quietly on a hot windy day or a cold snowy day?  Heat exchangers and acoustic absorbers will be need co-located inside the fan duct.  Heat exchangers will be needed to keep the motors and controllers cool or to prevent ice from accumulating in the inlet.  Acoustic absorbers are needed to reduce the noise produced by the fan and motor before it can propagate to the cabin and pollute the environment.  While aircraft engine acoustic liners and inlet anti-icing systems are already packaged into today’s turbofan engine inlets, new heat exchangers that will be part of the electric aircraft thermal management system must now be added.   

Traditionally, several components (e.g. rotor, guide vanes, nacelle, liners, heat exchangers) are built separately and assembled modularly. The function of each component is considered separately, and it becomes difficult to optimize the entire system, especially if acoustics and low-noise features are not included early in the component design.  Multifunctional structures to transfer heat and absorb sound, however, offer the promise of reduced weight and improved system performance.  Integrating the acoustic liner into the entire build of a ducted electrofan as a unit is an approach that has not been attempted before.  By using rapid prototyping techniques, the entire assembly can be built as a unit allowing even traditional acoustic technologies to be blended across the engine build. There are several potential benefits to this approach.  First, the total acoustic liner length could be increased which could help reduce noise emissions, especially for engines with short inlets.  Second, when multifunctional structures are tightly integrated into the ducted electrofans, we might be able to avoid seams and steps in the liner that are common problems with traditional liners.  Discontinuities in the acoustic liners can be a source of noise, and eliminating or reducing these discontinuities could improve liner performance and reduce aircraft engine noise pollution. 

NASA’s patented bio-inspired Broadband Acoustic Absorber (aka ‘bioliner’) has utilized additive manufacturing to rapidly prototype bioliner segments for proof-of-concept experiments.  Data from these experiments demonstrate that structures that resemble bundles of natural reeds can absorb sound over a wide frequency range (400 Hz to 3000Hz), and better than state-of-the-art for frequencies between 400 Hz to 1000 Hz. Thin, lightweight, and durable acoustic absorbers effective over a wide frequency range especially for low frequency sounds below 1000 Hz are needed for a broad range of aerospace, industrial, marine, and architectural noise control applications.  Maturation of the bioliner technology can easily be incorporated into the QUEEN development spirals.  

Since the Quiet Electric Engines being designed for the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (QUEEN) 25% Flight Research Vehicle will need to incorporate a heat exchanger that competes for volume within the nacelle that is also needed by the acoustic liner, multifunctional structures that can transfer heat and absorb sound are required.  The bioliner is one promising candidate for this test bed.  Bench tests of multifunctional structures will be needed to develop thermal and acoustic models so that these multifunctional structures can be optimized in the fan integration. Of vital importance to this compatibly is the bioliner team developing a model for design methodology. This is a necessary requirement to effectively mature the bioliner technology. However, early QUEEN prototypes can provide validation data sets for those models and essential design and manufacturability information.  ",,,,,,,,,

Title: Durability of Cryotanks for Aircraft via Flow-forming Technology (DuraCrAFT) 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and benefits).   

Problem 

The National Climate Action Plan for Aviation aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. One solution is the maturation of hydrogen-powered aircraft to achieve zero-emission flight. Given the urgency to meet carbon emission reduction targets, a reliable solution to storage of cryofuels is needed. The design and fabrication of cryotanks suitable for commercial aviation present numerous challenges in containing high-pressures (300 bar) at low temperatures (as low as 20 K) while delivering a lightweight, reliable solution. This proposal aims to utilize flow forming, a high-rate, low-cost metal forming process, to adapt the aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) tank design used for spaceflight hardware into unitized Al-Li tank structures that are weight-competitive with composites. 

 

Al-Li cryotanks have been used in space flight (e.g. external tanks) or developmental hydrogen-powered cars ​[1]​, however both applications have different requirements than aviation. Cryotanks for space flight, even the reusable versions, do not need to sustain thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles, while automotive cryotanks have more similar lifecycles, though do not need to focus on a lightweight design ​[2]​. Airbus and Universal Hydrogen are reportedly preparing metallic cryotanks for use in hydrogen-powered aircraft, however there is no report of utilizing unitized (less weld length resulting in less leaks) and integrally stiffened (better performance) structures enabled by flow forming ​[3]​. Unitized and integrally stiffened tanks fabricated from Al-Li may offer greater reliability and durability than both conventional metallic and composite designs to sustain the many pressure and temperature cycles of flight and refueling, as well as more easily meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, such as crashworthiness and inspectability. Additionally, the high costs of composite cryotanks are acceptable for high-budget spaceflight applications. However, for the near-term need of sustainable aviation, the cost of composite cryotanks for aircraft may be prohibitive ​[4]​.  

 

While flow forming offers beneficial weight and rate savings over conventional manufacturing, there are still open questions regarding the durability of flow-formed cryotanks for aircraft applications. Flow forming imparts significant coldworking (and potential residual stresses), which raises concerns for the crack initiation and propagation performance over thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles. Additionally, hydrogen embrittlement is a concern for aluminum cryotanks, especially if cracks are introduced. 

 

Approach 

The conventional metallic cryotank fabrication approach utilizes welding to piece together dozens of panels to form a tank. However, forming has been shown to reduce weight by 5-8% in large-scale domes and tanks by eliminating a significant fraction of welds through unitization ​[5]​. Additionally, since leaks tend to occur at welded joints rather than acreage, the reduction of the total weld length should create a less permeable structure. The integrally stiffened cryotank serves as a further improvement over the state of the art by reducing the number of secondary reinforcement structures needed. Flow forming a cryotank for aircraft has not been attempted likely due to the limited number of research-grade advanced forming equipment available. The durability of flow-formed cryotanks is largely unknown and must be understood in order mature this technology, thus starting with fatigue testing and residual stress measurements is a logical first step. 

 

Impact 

This proposal aims to survey and elucidate the not-well-understood durability of flow-formed structures for long-life aircraft applications, specifically targeting the crack initiation behavior of flow-formed parts under cyclical loading. Tayon et al. ​[6]​ have shown improved toughness in flow formed aluminum 6061 as compared to wrought plate, however other durability issues such as fatigue strength and crack propagation are unexplored. Instead of relying on a build and test strategy to demonstrate durability, this proposal sets the stage by collecting data needed to develop predictive models. The predictive capabilities should reduce the need for excessive characterization and testing as cryotank (and future structure) designs change. Coupling a finite element model (DEFORM) that predicts microstructure and a crack formation and propagation model allows for intelligent, efficient process optimization instead of lengthy empirical approaches. If successful, this proposal could result in a pathway to a reliable, cost-effective, manufacturable metallic cryotank capable of meeting net-zero carbon aviation goals. Secondly, the capability of predicting flow-formed microstructures and mechanical properties can be leveraged for efficient design and production of other flow-formed aerospace structures such as fuselages, nacelles, nozzles, and nose cones. 

 

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

This proposal for assessing the durability of flow-formed articles for aircraft cryotanks culminates in the following milestones: 

Mechanical test data (at cryo-temperatures), focusing on fatigue testing, using existing integrally stiffened aluminum 2195 flow-formed parts. This data will be benchmarked against handbook values or experimental data generated by testing on rolled plate with the same geometry. (1-9 months) 

Characterization of the microstructure, which will be guided by the microstructural factors that are known to influence crack initiation, with special attention to the microstructural statistics needed for modeling durability behaviors. (1-9 months)  

Discovery phase which will assess durability properties that have the greatest impact on the performance of a metallic cryotank based on available research to guide the next phase of testing. (9-11 months) 

Final report summarizing the findings and suggesting future work. (11-12 months) 

The characterization effort should be assessed by the ability for the microstructural data to be inputted into a model to predict the mechanical behavior in question and sufficient data to demonstrate the fatigue life of flow-formed parts (with reduced residual stresses). The discovery phase should be evaluated on the evidence that supports a suggested testing plan in the next phase. 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps/transition/follow-on research?  

This proposal aims to set the direction and foundation for developing a viable and reliable metallic cryotank to enable net-zero carbon flight. The next steps are to pursue modeling of durability and microstructure of flow formed structures; testing; structural design and optimization; and manufacturing demonstrators. The question of reliability will be addressed in part by a two-pronged modeling effort. The first is to expand upon current finite element capabilities using DEFORM to predict microstructures of flow formed parts. The second is to use the microstructural and mechanical property data from this work to validate a model and predict durability of flow-formed structures, potentially collaborating with the crack initiation modeling team in TTT. Commensurate experimental parts will be flow formed on NASA LaRC’s VUD-600 vertical forming machine and characterized to add further data to the model. Full-cylinder fatigue testing (and other durability tests like crack propagation) will be pursued to assess in the influence of residual stresses.  

The actual design and fabrication of the cryotak also requires attention. A structural optimization study will work on designing the cryotank with input from the mechanical testing results as well as with consideration of FAA certification requirements, such as crashworthiness and inspectability. Additional input would be sought from Vadim Lvovich at Glenn Research Center who is leading a project focusing on hydrogen-powered aircraft propulsion.  

From the proposed design, a sub-scale demonstration article can be flow-formed, which is envisioned to be formed in two parts. A unitized dome and cylinder (spin and flow formed) would be friction stir welded to a second spin-formed dome. The sub-scale demonstrator would be tested for durability using an existing cylinder pressure tester capable of cyclical testing up to 5000 psi. The current proposal and these next steps will answer key questions about the durability of integrally stiffened flow formed cryotanks for adoption by the green aviation industry. 

Address the following hypothetical scenario from your perspective as PI: work not feasible?  

Flow forming offers numerous benefits, including a high manufacturing rate, the ability to fabricate thin, integrally stiffened cylinders (and domes), and cost-effectiveness, thus if the fatigue life is determined to be a showstopper, the issue would be remedied on a material and structural level. On the material level, focusing on understanding the underlying mechanism causing poor performance could give direction on how to mitigate the issue. Some potential options are to perform thermomechanical processing to relieve residual stress or change the underlying microstructure to achieve better performance. If that proves unsuccessful, fabricating parts out of a different alloy using the VUD-600 to achieve adequate properties or from existing extruded integrally stiffened 2195 panels would be pursued. A structural design, possibly including additional secondary structures, could be pursued to further increase the fatigue life. A short trade study would follow to understand the impact from the proposed changes on the weight, volume, manufacturability, and performance of the cryotank.

Stator core material development for next generation electric motors,TTT Green Aviation,,"FY24 Green Aviation Proposal (TTT) Title: Stator core material development for next generation electric motors 1. Work Description What problem are you solving? NASA identifies Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) as a leading strategy to reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions associated with aviation. Across the competing EAP system topologies, common power density targets have been identified for electric motors (>10 kW/kg) and the associated power electronics (>20 kW/kg) to enable closed designs and compete with existing turbine power densities (~13 kW/kg) [1]. Significant research is focused on the development and demonstration of subsystems and systems that meet the difficult requirements for this application. The current state of the art for aviation rated electric motors is assessed to be 5-7 kW/kg [2], approximately half the target value. This proposal targets improvement in the magnetic material used in electric motor stators to achieve the targeted power density. Power in a motor is given as 𝑃 = 𝜏𝜔, where 𝜏 is the torque and 𝜔 is the rotational speed. Strategies to increase motor power density seek to increase these parameters. Torque is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field between the rotor and stator (airgap flux density), and the radius Maxwell force. Large radii are not preferred for aviation applications due to drag and volume considerations, so that large flux densities are preferred to increase torque. High performance motors typically use FeCo alloys that have saturation flux densities near 𝐵𝑠 = 2.4 T, the highest value of any known bulk industrial material. No known pathways exist to develop bulk ferromagnetic materials with higher flux densities, but superconducting machines offer a possible solution if the necessary cryogenic conditions can be maintained. The rotational speed of aviation propulsion motors is typically 2-3 krpm, limited by tip speed for direct drive connections. Faster motor speeds may be possible with the addition of reduction gearing, that is common in many aircraft applications and has a relatively low impact to the total power density [3]. Other possibilities exist for direct drive use of high-speed motors or engine driven generators that operate near turbine speeds (15-20 krpm). High power motors in this speed range are common for terrestrial applications such as gas compression or fly wheel storage but no demonstrations exist for MW-scale high speed aviation motors[4]. Motor components that produce AC flux (soft magnetic materials and windings) produce heat proportional to the electrical frequency, and thermal management limits the maximum speed a motor can achieve. Improved thermal systems, high temperature materials, and different motor topologies can mitigate these effects but improved magnetic materials that can operate efficiently at high frequency without excess heat production enable power density improvements without contributing to the thermal problem. Given the lack of a research path toward improving torque, we identify the increase of motor speed as the most likely path to achieve the required >2X improvement in non-superconducting aircraft electric motor power density. Many different motor topologies exist, with brushless DC permanent magnet motors currently showing the highest power densities along with promising results from switched reluctance designs that require more complex controls. This can be attributed to the lack of rotor windings and mainly DC rotor flux that does not generate frequency related heat in these topologies. The stator and stator windings of these designs produce the required AC flux and we target the stator for improvement. Due to the variations in motor design, we propose the development of a motor stator capable of flux densities near the current state of the art (>1.5 T) with power losses at high frequency (>2 kHz) less than those produced in current materials at 1 kHz. This sets a performance target and motivates the development of a low loss, high saturation induction magnetic material and a manufacturing process to package this material into a suitable stator. Has this been tried before? Why/why not? Losses in laminated metallic soft magnetic materials have two components; those that are dependent or independent of the excitation frequency. The frequency dependent components are mostly related to eddy currents that are inversely proportional to the lamination. Recent commercial efforts successfully reduced motor stack lamination thickness in bulk crystalline FeCo alloys(Hiperco, Vacoflux, etc…) down to 50 μm [5,6], resulted in a 2X reduction in losses compared to previous lamination thicknesses (Figure 1 left). The measured core loss of ~50 W/kg at 1 kHz is the upper limit of thermal load for a conventional motor design. Therefore, thinner laminations allow for higher excitation frequency for the same thermal load. While this is a significant improvement, the frequency independent component of losses in bulk crystalline alloys are high due to the large grain size and significant magnetostriction. No bulk crystalline materials with saturation induction Bs>1.5 T and zero magnetostriction are currently known. Figure 1: Comparison of core losses (W/kg) vs induction (T) in a bulk crystalline FeCo alloy with 50μm thick laminations to a similar alloy with 6mil (150μm) laminations at 1kHz (left) and a FeSi-based nanocomposite at 5kHz (right). We propose improvements to stator performance beyond what is possible in bulk crystalline stator materials with grain size typically >10 μm. Nanocomposite soft magnetic materials produced from rapidly solidified amorphous ribbon can have significantly lower losses compared to thin crystalline FeCo motor alloys (Figure 1 right). This is due to the small grain size (20ppm) or FeSi-based nanocomposites with low saturation induction (10 W/kg. 2. Milestones The concept described above, through the final demonstration of low losses in a packaged stator, represents a development effort greater than 1 year. The proposed work for this project seeks to assess feasibility and demonstrate a proof of concept: • 3mo - Identify research paths to produce nanocomposite alloys with Bs>1.5 T and low magnetostriction |λs|1.5 T and |λs|",,,,,,,,,
Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT 

FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE 

Title: Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion 

1. Development and implementation of electrified propulsion systems are a key component to achieving the green aviation targets laid out in the ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Electrified propulsion requires achieving high energy densities, either through improved energy storage technologies or reduced weight of aircraft components. Regarding the latter, electrified propulsion is expected to lead to an increase in the required electrical wiring. Therefore, developing lightweight, high voltage, i.e., for high power, cables is desirable. Cables consist of an inner electrical conductor surrounded by insulating material.  Both conductor and insulation materials require optimization.  Here we focus on the inner conductor.  Recently, a study from Glenn Research Center by Almansour et al. [1] investigated the possibility of replacing pure copper (Cu) conductors with Cu-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. They found, through a trial-and-error process of testing different fabrication techniques and composite compositions, that it was possible to increase electrical conductivity by 4.8% compared to traditional Cu cables. As a result, these Cu/CNT composite cables, able to deliver the same amount of power as state-of-the-art Cu cables, offered a 13.5% weight reduction. Despite this success, the properties of different Cu/CNT samples were inconsistent due to difficulty in achieving a uniform Cu coating on the CNTs (Figure 1). Nonuniform Cu coatings also made the cables more susceptible to failure when placed under stress. A better understanding of the basic Cu deposition processes underlying Cu/CNT fabrication would undoubtedly help to optimize the process and produce cables with consistently improved properties. Using physics-based modeling, this work aims to provide strategies for how uniform Cu coatings can be deposited onto CNTs. Optimized Cu/CNT fabrication should be able to produce cables with >20% weight reduction compared to state-of-the-art Cu cables. 

 

Figure 1: Examples of nonuniform Cu coatings on CNTs from [1]. 

We plan to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study how Cu atoms attach to the Cu-CNT interfaces. MD simulations are a technique which allows for the tracking of the motion of individual atoms in a system using a parametrized interatomic potential (force field) model. Cu deposition is an atomic scale process which is well-suited to study with this technique. MD simulations have been utilized extensively to study the mechanical behavior of composites composed of Cu and different carbon allotropes [2,3] as well as the growth of graphene on Cu surfaces (Figure 2) [4,5]. Therefore, there are several existing interatomic potential models which can be utilized to perform new MD simulations of the Cu coating process. The atomic scale resolution of MD simulations will provide insights into the fabrication of Cu/CNT composites previously inaccessible to experimental techniques. 

We expect that the curvature resulting from the CNT radius will affect Cu deposition. Therefore, an initial series of MD simulations will be performed with a flat sheet of graphene (an unrolled CNT) to serve as a comparison and testbed for different simulation conditions. The Cu deposition will be performed at several different rates and temperatures to determine how this affects formation of the Cu layer. Deposition parameters favoring the formation of a uniform Cu coating will be carried over into subsequent simulations. Additionally, graphene, and as a result CNTs, are known to possess several structural defects [6], including vacancies, adatoms, and dislocations, which could serve as preferential sites for Cu attachment. Deposition simulations of Cu in the presence of structural defects will indicate if such “nucleation sites” favor the formation of nonuniform coatings and would thereby be detrimental to Cu/CNT composite fabrication. 

The second series of simulations will focus directly on CNTs. Depending on how the carbon atoms are connected, CNTs can have two different conformations (“armchair” and “zigzag”) in addition to having variable radii. Indeed, in the study done by Almansour et al. [1] the CNTs were not characterized – effectively random CNT characteristics could have contributed to the inconsistency in Cu/CNT composite properties. Therefore, MD simulations will be performed to deposit Cu atoms on CNTs of varying characteristics and elucidate how this may impact the quality of the resulting Cu coating. These MD simulations will provide strategic insight into how the Cu deposition process can be tuned to produce Cu/CNT composites with a desirable uniform Cu coating. This will enable dramatically more consistent fabrication of Cu/CNT cables which offer significant weight savings over existing Cu cables for application in electrified propulsion systems. 

2. This work will be divided into the following milestones: 

Q1: Evaluation and selection of an appropriate interatomic potential model 

Q1-Q2: MD simulations of Cu deposition on graphene 

Q3-Q4: MD simulations of Cu deposition on CNTs. 

The following success criteria will be used to evaluate this work: 

Cu deposition parameters which favor uniform coating are determined. 

Structural defects detrimental to uniform Cu deposition are identified. 

Trends in CNT characteristics best suited for uniform Cu coatings are determined. 

3. After the completion of this work, the insights gained from MD simulations into the Cu coating process should be directly applied to Cu/CNT composite fabrication, e.g., optimal deposition parameters and selection of CNTs with favorable characteristics. Electrical conductivity measurements will allow for the weight savings due to Cu/CNT cables to be determined. Follow-on research should focus on applying quantum mechanics-based calculations to determine the electrical conductivity of CNTs with Cu attached at different sites. These types of calculations using density functional theory (DFT) have been well-established [7] and would provide further insight, beyond the capabilities of MD simulations, into which CNTs offer superior properties for Cu/CNT cables. 

4. The reliability of the MD simulation depends on the quality of employed interatomic potential model. If we find that Cu-C interatomic potentials available in literature are not good enough for our study the research will pivot to the development of a new interatomic potential model for the Cu-CNT system. The development of a new model could be beneficial for studying multi-metal deposition onto CNTs. The inclusion of some carbide-forming metals such as Fe and Ni can result in improved bonding at the Cu-CNT interface [8], making this an alternative strategy to fabricating reliable Cu/CNT composites. Once the potential is developed, we will come back to the research plan described above.

Title: Integration of hydrogen fuel tanks in aircraft design - volume study 

The objective of the study is to review the vehicle configuration and structural design issues related to the integration of fuel tanks for storage of liquid or gaseous hydrogen into novel forms of aircraft design. The motivation for this study is that efficient hydrogen storage is a key enabling technology for the advancement of sustainable aviation applications, including hydrogen-powered conventional aviation concepts as well as the design of revolutionary environmentally friendly vehicles.  

Compared to jet fuel, hydrogen has a gravimetric density that is 2.8 times higher than jet fuel. However, even in a liquid state (LH2), hydrogen has a 4.1 times lower volumetric density than jet fuel. Taken together, this this means LH2 requires larger tanks that must be maintained at cryogenic temperatures, even though hydrogen has 2.8 times more energy per kilogram than jet fuel. Compared to liquid hydrogen, gaseous hydrogen (GH2) needs to be compressed and, for conventional tanks, the operating pressure is typically not higher than 700 bar. Even at this high pressure and room temperature, the gas density is 1.8 times less than liquid hydrogen, which means less hydrogen for a given tank size. Larger tanks would be needed to store the same amount of hydrogen as liquid hydrogen tanks. For the current gaseous hydrogen tanks, pressurized to 700 bars, the tank volume to store the same amount of energy would be 7.5 times that of the JP-7 fuel tank.  

Therefore, three problems related to tank design and integration into overall vehicle design are: tank volume, to which tank structural mass is related, and tank materials which are related to decrease of structural mass. Hydrogen tanks have larger volumes because of lower values of liquid or gaseous hydrogen volumetric energy densities than conventional aircraft fuel. The extremely high operation pressure of gaseous hydrogen, which would equal 2,000 bar to pack the same energy as LH2 in the same volume, results in unacceptable structural mass with traditional materials. The technology readiness levels for the expected nano materials are not high enough to consider them in the tank design in the foreseeable future.

This study will address volumetric integration of hydrogen tanks into aircraft configurations that would match tank volume requirements.  

Upper consideration will guide in matching tank to the aircraft: GH2 tanks to the short route commuter, and LH2 to the long route transcontinental and intercontinental aircraft.  

Currently there is a lot of work in industry that spans more immediate needs that airline industry will face with regulations by 2030 such as: accommodation of current aircraft to larger tanks, accommodation of airport infrastructure to supply of hydrogen, and development and testing of new engines to use either hydrogen directly or through conversion to electricity with fuel cells.

Title: Initial Study of Airspace Operational Impacts of Airline Contrail Mitigation Actions 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?

MOTIVATION 

The aviation community is actively tackling a potentially significant contributor to global climate change: persistent contrails formed from aviation operations. The Contrail Impact Task Force—which includes most major U.S.-based airlines (e.g., American, Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, United, UPS), several international carriers, NASA, Boeing, Airbus, GE, Google, Breakthrough Energy, academia, and other research organizations—is concerned that airspace operations could be a potential barrier to performing contrail avoidance actions as part of routine flight operations. 

There is a need to perform an initial analysis of whether such a potential barrier exists and, if so, the scope of the challenge. This analysis requires an independent, trusted source that has credibility with airspace and air traffic modeling, which NASA has and can provide. The initial results would have broad visibility in the aviation community and can help air carriers plan upcoming flight trials and incorporate contrail formation avoidance actions into accepted operational flight plans. 

PROPOSAL 

The first part of the proposed effort is to calculate ATC-related metrics (e.g., sector counts, proximity events) across the NAS utilizing existing simulation data collected during a prior study commissioned by the ARMD Portfolio Analysis and Management Office (PAMO). The NAS-wide analysis proposed here—1) identify specific “hotspot” areas of the NAS that require deeper dive analysis; 2) uncover airspace complexities of contrail formation avoidance that may require additional algorithm development; and 3) raise additional questions for follow-on research—has not been conducted previously. Prior analysis of four sectors in Kansas City Center found that contrail avoidance actions would not lead to an increase in sector counts above capacity.1-2 However, the researchers did not extend this analysis to the entire NAS in follow-on studies. Instead, they focused on 1) refining their environmental impact models of contrails; and 2) comparing contrail formation avoidance strategies in terms of the tradeoff in fuel burn and delay. 

The second part of the proposed effort is to receive and incorporate into NAS-wide simulations flight plan data from a major airline that includes 1) realistic business preferences; and 2) vertical and lateral flight plans, with and without changes for contrail avoidance (e.g., American Airlines (AA); potentially leveraging an existing Space Act Agreement (SAA)). This would be unprecedented research that the aviation community could utilize to shape the future approach for routine operationalization of contrail avoidance. 

The first part of the proposed effort will be documented in an interim report and presented to NASA, the Contrail Impact Task Force, and other stakeholders. The second part of the proposed effort will be added to the interim report to produce a final report that will also be presented to stakeholders and published. The final report will also document a validation of the contrail formation model utilized in the proposed effort that will include comparing model outputs to satellite images. 

BACKGROUND 

There is an increasing body of evidence that persistent contrails formed from aviation operations is a significant contributor to global climate change. One study estimated that persistent contrails contribute about 57% of total Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) from aviation operations (Figure 1). 

 

Figure 1. Global aviation Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF).3 

The aviation community is taking this matter seriously. Recently, several airlines and ANSPs have conducted flight trials to evaluate the operational feasibility and potential environmental impact of contrail avoidance strategies. These initial contrail mitigation trials and related modeling and analysis efforts found a net environmental benefit from reducing contrail-induced cirrus cloud cover trapping heat in the atmosphere, even with the additional fuel burn from flying at sub-optimal cruise altitudes. 

Following a workshop co-sponsored by NASA in September 2022 on Operationalizing Contrail Avoidance, industry formed the Contrail Impact Task Force, which meets quarterly to share information about contrail mitigation trials and other efforts associated with contrail impact modeling. In addition to business incentives, policy, technology, operational procedures, and fully understanding the scientific impacts of contrail avoidance, the task force raised airspace operations as a potential barrier. There is concern that contrail avoidance actions could 1) create workload issues for Air Traffic Control (ATC); and 2) create additional airspace congestion. 

NASA’s hypothesis is that airspace operations are a minimal barrier to establishing contrail mitigation programs because 1) only a small percentage of flights would be impacted—about 7.5% of flights in an initial NASA simulation study in which flight cruise altitudes were changed to avoid contrail formation; and 2) the airspace and air traffic management system has embedded design flexibility to accommodate airspace user preferences for flight plan routes and altitudes. Existing unique NASA capabilities and expertise can be leveraged to produce analytic evidence to support or refute this hypothesis in support of the efforts of the Contrail Impact Task Force, NASA, and the aviation community at large.

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate? 

The proposed effort is an initial study to identify “hotspot” areas of the NAS that require deeper dive analysis, uncover airspace complexities of contrail formation avoidance, and raise additional questions for follow-on research.

Hypothetical situation: Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue? 

The first portion of the proposed effort is to calculate ATC-related metrics from simulation data with and without contrail avoidance that were collected for the foundational study commissioned by ARMD PAMO. This work is feasible technically because the required data to perform this analysis already exists. 

The second portion of the proposed effort involves receiving flight plan data with and without changes for contrail avoidance from a major airline that includes business preferences to incorporate into NAS Digital Twin (NDT) simulations (Figure 2). The proposed approach to obtain this data is through an existing SAA. If this is not feasible, our alternative approach is to develop our own model—working with subject matter experts (e.g., former airline and FAA folks with related knowledge and experience)—of airline business preferences and resulting flight plans, with and without contrail avoidance actions.

Title: Sustainable bio-aerogels for direct air carbon capture and storage 

Description of Work 

 

As outlined in the US 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan, the aviation industry has an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 [1]. For this purpose, governments and aircraft manufacturers are developing and pursuing action plans and technologies such as developing more efficient aircraft (e.g., hybrid and electric aircraft) and using low-carbon alternative fuels (e.g., biofuels) to reduce the aviation carbon footprint [2]. However, these efforts are not enough for the industry to meet its carbon reduction goals as the global demand for air travel is rising. Therefore, complementary solutions are needed to offer a safe, affordable, and scalable pathway for aviation emission reduction.  

Recently, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technology was proposed by the major industry players as a complementary plan to capture the residual emissions remaining from aircraft directly from the air and later store them underground [3]. Although these proposed ground facilities can potentially capture tons of carbon directly from the air, they require so much energy to capture carbon dioxide, purify it, and transport it underground for permanent storage which make them not an affordable and scalable way to sequester carbon [4].  

In this proposal, an alternative approach for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air will be investigated by developing novel sustainable bio-based aerogels. Bio-aerogels are low-density materials with high open-porosity and high specific surface area that are made from biodegradable polymer precursors such as proteins, starch, sugar cane and vegetable oils. Recent developments have shown these materials are excellent for various applications like environmental remediation [5]. The NASA GRC Polymer Aerogel Team has recently considered a new chemistry for the synthesis of bio-based aerogels that can be potentially utilized for carbon dioxide adsorption, and storage. These materials can be chemically functionalized using specific moieties such as organic amines to adsorb carbon dioxide directly from air into their nanoporous structures under ambient conditions. The significance of using bio-aerogels for environmental remediation applications in comparison with traditional polymer aerogels is in their ability to decompose into natural substances in a short period of time which is increasingly important for a sustainable future. In addition to this added benefit, the bio-aerogel still retains typical aerogel properties such as lightweight, low density, low thermal conductivity, acoustic impedance, and structural integrity from cryogenic temperatures to 500 °C. 

The utilization of bio-aerogels with carbon dioxide adhesion capability in Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technologies can significantly reduce the overall cost of these systems: 1) it will create a more environmentally-friendly process and be more attractive to industry as the bio-aerogels will be used for the carbon dioxide capture without any purification need, 2) these materials will also act as natural filter with high storage capacity due to their high porosity (>95%) and high internal surface area (800m2/g), and 3) due to their sustainability and biocompatibility, they can be directly stored underground without any environmental concern.

Milestones/Deliverables 

A feasibility and optimization study will be performed to determine viable bio-based aerogel candidates. Milestone 1 entails the synthesis of baseline bio-aerogels and characterization through a series of thermal, mechanical, and physical property analysis. Milestone 2 will focus on down-selecting viable candidates for fabrication of Optimal formulations. The optimized bio-aerogels will be selected based on comparison of key performance parameters of current state of the art materials for carbon capture. Milestone 3 will entail fabrication of the optimal aerogel formulation and testing in a relevant environment to determine the carbon dioxide adsorption capability of the bio-aerogel material. Milestone 4 will include a materials assessment and a final report.

Infusion/Follow-on Technology 

Upon the successful outcome of this project, the technology can be infused into additional projects and programs within ARMD’s Transformative Aeronautics Concept Program such as Convergent Aeronautics Solutions (CAS) projects, new programs similar to NASA’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) Project, and the agency’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project. In addition, collaboration with industry will be sought in order to implement the bio-aerogel materials into DACCS systems. It is anticipated that this will also be of interest to areas within STMD for applications such as Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) of the Atmosphere Revitalization Systems (ARS) for crewed vehicles and habitats. 

 

Project Viability 

 Although the confidence for success in this proposed work is high, the potential for redirection of research due to unforeseen failures or other circumstances is a possibility. With this adverse situation in mind, there are measures built into the proposal to avoid such issues. Due to the nature of the research to be attempted, an optimization study will be conducted to first assess viability and baseline properties.  This offers alternative approaches to fabricate various chemistries to best define the optimal methods and materials to make the bio-aerogel. If the initial approach is not feasible, we will adjust the parameters such as chemical precursors, synthesis methods, and chemical composition. ",,,,,,,,,
Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Title: Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation 

The aviation industry is a rapidly growing sector with an increasing environmental impact. At just a fraction of the global production, Airbus’s fleet forecast alone projects a 4.1% compounding annual growth rate and over 40,000 new aircraft and freighters to be required over the next 20 years [1]. Consequently, meeting both net zero emissions and sustainability goals requires next generation aircraft to incorporate reusability and recyclability of materials in their design criteria, creating a closed-loop lifecycle, while simultaneously providing performance gains for improved efficiency. 

By leveraging eco-friendly thermal management solutions, aircraft, in particular electrified and hybrid aircraft, and urban air mobility (UAM) systems can benefit from reduced operating temperatures with enhanced efficiency while also taking advantage of material recyclability for reuse in a sustainable closed-loop product lifecycle. Component systems such as batteries, fuel cells, and electric motors provide large opportunity for impact where increased specific power, energy and reliability could be achieved through improved thermal management and contribute to improved aircraft efficiency and reduced emissions. Specifically, this proposal will target the enhancement of electric motors for aircraft propulsion through the development of multifunctional high thermal conductivity bobbins that extract, store, and redistribute the generated heat. In electric motors, bobbins are the permanent containers for the retention of coiled wire shapes and rigidity, and enable easier assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. Given that these coils are the greatest source of heating within the stator and typically within the whole electric motor, efficient thermal management through the bobbin is critical to motor performance. 

Based on a study for NASA electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) electric motor design, the stator winding thermomechanical stress is a more significant limiting factor for electric motors than thermochemical aging of the insulation [2]. For this reason, cooling strategies and technologies that reduce thermally induced stator coil mechanical stress are needed to advance the achievable performance of EAP motors. One path forward to achieve reduced coil mechanical stress is through an in-slot direct cooling design [3]. Additionally, a recent study at NASA GRC leveraged a multi-physics design optimization model to demonstrate mass reduction achieved with an in-slot design relative to a water-jacket design, as well as increased motor efficiency by incorporating a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity [4].  

Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material designs to advance electric motor state-of-the-art through enhanced thermal management capabilities and reduced thermo-mechanical stress. Multi-material including ceramics, high-performance composites, alumina-filled Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), carbon-reinforced Polyetherimide (ULTEM), Silicon Carbide, and Boron Nitride are prime candidates demonstrating desired properties for this application. Combined with in-house additive manufacturing capabilities and prior success 3D printing multi-materials [5, 6, 7], designs incorporating complex geometry, cooling channels, or reduced weight could also be achieved. This is especially beneficial with fabricating materials that are difficult to machine through traditional methods and could provide new avenues for the application of these materials. Moreover, thermal storage materials such phase change materials (PCM) can be integrated into the bobbins design to store the extracted heat from the motor wiring and then recycle and use the stored thermal energy elsewhere in the aircraft. Additionally, high thermal conductivity interface coatings which facilitate increased thermal extraction from the coil winding to bobbin could be also investigated.  

Although there has been plenty of work in motor design for propulsion, there has not been a large focus on material development and thermal management for the bobbin component. In one study, a negative correlation with increasing bobbin thermal conductivity and decreased bobbin temperature, achieved through injected molded plastics with fillers, was demonstrated [8]. Another investigation found similar results for a direct winding heat exchanger design [9]. Research in this area is multi-faceted and has not fully explored the potential of thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-materials, where polyamides and glass-fiber reinforcement have been the common materials currently used [10, 11]. Therefore, an opportunity for fabricating an electric motor with improved efficiency is provided by developing a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity for enhanced thermal management. This design should also balance a reduced mass and provide sufficient reduction in thermo-mechanical stresses for improved and reliable performance. Overall, the enhanced efficiency of electric motors and the reduction of power losses due to excess heat will expand the capabilities of electrified aircraft and UAM while increasing sustainability and durability. Furthermore, thermoplastics such as PEKK and ULTEM provide an opportunity for further mitigating waste and emissions through recycling, as they can be recovered, remelted, and reused for fabrication in a closed-loop cycle for green aviation.  

 

Several milestones are anticipated for this work: 

Identify thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material architecture for bobbin fabrication (12/2023) 

Design and develop processing conditions for successful multi-material additive manufacturing (5/2024) 

Evaluate multi-material composite thermal and thermomechanical properties under simulated operational environmental conditions (7/2024) 

Fabricate proto-type components using additive manufacturing approaches (9/2024) 

This work should be evaluated on the successful fabrication of a bobbin as well as its thermal management capability, where increased thermal conductivity and reduced maximum bobbin temperature will demonstrate improved performance relative to a baseline design. Additionally, the developed bobbin’s ability to extract heat will be measured with the use of customized experimental setup. 

 

Upon successful fabrication of a thermally conductive electrically insulative bobbin, next steps could include further material development and incorporating fabricated components in a motor prototype. A full evaluation of enhanced thermal management for an enhanced motor and a baseline motor could be conducted for comparison, for instance at NASA AFRC or at GRC with small motor test facilities established under CAMIEM. Additionally, more complex components and improved integration within the electric motor could be investigated and tests conducted to determine performance gains over the baseline motor. This could include consolidating multiple components into a single manufacturing step, such as 3d printing a bobbin with copper coils simultaneously. This could result in reduced number of parts, reduced failure points, and reduced weight. There may also be opportunities for transition and collaboration with other NASA projects such as testing with the in-slot cooling rig being constructed under RVLT or the statorette heating cooling rig at GRC. At a later stage this could also involve identifying an opportunity for an in-flight test such as with the sustainable flight demonstrator project. Upon successful demonstration, this technology could also be transferred to engine companies.  

 

With the array of in-house additive manufacturing capabilities available, we are able to 3D print even the highest-performance high-temperature materials available on the market and do not anticipate any feasibility issues. However, if issues do arise, fabrication could be outsourced to local vendors. If there is an issue regarding the chosen thermally conductive electrically insulative material, whether its printability or performance, alternative materials could be used for fabrication. If the entire approach was deemed infeasible, alternative thermal management solutions could be explored. Battery housings and heat sinks leveraging these materials could be fabricated to assist with the prevention and mitigation of thermal runaway events. This is of critical importance for the adoption of electrified aircraft for green aviation and could provide both thermo-mechanical robustness alongside weight savings and increased power density. Additionally, the fabrication of heat exchangers with multifunctional materials for extreme environments could serve to provide enhanced thermal management capability alongside improved reliability and performance. A novel design incorporating lightweight high-performance materials could also be fabricated through additive manufacturing and contribute to weight reduction of the aircraft.

Title: Integrated Catalytic Converters for Air Vehicle NOx Emission Control 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong? What is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable? Please include references/citations to back up claims where appropriate.  

Text BoxNASA challenge: This work has the ambition to design a catalytic converter for NOx emission control using computational methods targeted for an aircraft engine environment. Uncontrolled emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), formed as side-products during combustion of jet fuel, is a global environmental and health hazard.[1] Notably, NOx causes acid rain, smog, and eutrophication. In addition, NOx indirectly contributes to global warming through a complex reaction network that generates the greenhouse gases ozone and nitrous oxide. The adverse influence is significant as the effective global warming potential of NOx is estimated to be 30-35 times that of CO2 over a 20 years perspective.[2] Unfavorably for aircrafts, the harm increases when NOx is emitted at higher altitudes. While emission of NOx from automobile combustion engines has been successfully reduced using catalytic converters, the corresponding emission control is lacking for air vehicles. A key obstacle to the implementation of traditional catalytic converters in aircraft is its negative impact on the performance of the engine. For efficient NOx conversion, the exhaust gas needs extended contact time with the catalyst’s surface by passing the gas over a catalyst-impregnated filter bed. For aircraft, such an arrangement would result in decreased jet thrust – thus reducing engine performance to an unacceptable level. Leveraging the years of industrial research on NOx emission control for automobiles, this project aims to outline pathways toward alternative designs of catalytic converters for state-of-the-art jet engines. Furthermore, the aspiration is to enable codesign of future engines with the vision of power-efficient and truly carbon-neutral jet aircraft of tomorrow.  Such aircraft of the future will be optimized for both performance and emissions reduction. In this project, we will tailor, using advanced computational methods, novel catalysts targeted for aircraft engine environments and NOx reduction. As far as the author is aware, this modeling effort (albeit state-of-the-art in catalysis research) is a novel direction for catalytic converters designed for aircraft that can open up multiple future avenues in green aviation research. 

Objective and benefit: The overall objective of the proposed project is to lay the theoretical foundation for the design of an integrated catalytic converter for high velocity airflows. The converter solution will be optimized for aircraft conditions and will be applied as a surface coating on components within the jet engine (see Figure 1). This would result in minimal influence on the propulsion with the aim to reduce a significant fraction (1-5%) of the NOx emission. Hence, the converter will be designed to balance engine performance and emission reduction. With a combined annual NOx emission from global air traffic of 106 ton or 30×106 ton CO2,eq (i.e., same order of magnitude as the total energy related CO2 emission of a mid-sized US state),[1,3,4] removing even a small portion of the total NOx emission would have a large beneficial impact on both global health and global warming. Additionally, the modeling framework developed here will be specifically developed to have flexibility to address NOx abatement in other engine systems to allow for design of future jet engine solutions approaching 100% greenhouse gas neutrality.    

Approach: We will leverage established modeling methods used for identification of the so-called “three way catalyst” (Pt) used for NOx emission control in automobiles.[5,6] We aim to recast these established models in the context of air vehicles that operate at different conditions and have altered design criteria compared to automobiles. In particular, it is believed that the optimal catalyst could vary within the combustion chamber and turbine along with variations in local temperature, pressure, and gas velocity. In addition, materials durability (including high-temperature stability) and expense will be auxiliary design criteria allowing for a trade-off between catalysts performance and cost. 

In heterogenous catalysis theory, it is common to employ a so-called Sabatier analysis of the factors influencing the catalytic system. One benefit of this approach is that the catalytic activity of a catalyst can be reduced to a few key parameters, parameters that are easy to compute or measure experimentally. The approach can be used to screen for ideal catalysts within a large materials search space. We strive to mainly harness literature data in this work, with complementary first principles atomic scale modeling of missing reaction energies and barriers.   

A picture containing graphical user interface

Description automatically generatedIn principle, the catalytic performance is defined by the free energy landscape of reactants, intermediates, and products on the catalytic surface. Typically, the best catalyst is the one that balances between properly activating the reacting species without binding the product too strongly (which leads to surface poisoning). The energetics of the surface species are not independent but scale within groups of similar compounds.[7]For example, it is common that all species that bind via an N atom (such as NO, NH etc) scale with the adsorption energy of atomic nitrogen, while carbon compounds (e.g., CO) scale with atomic carbon. In addition, the energy barrier going from one state to another has been found to scale linearly with the reaction energy of that step (so-called BEP relations).[8] By joining these relationship, one can express the energy landscape reduced to a few key descriptors (adsorption energies). The rate of catalysis, also known as turn over frequency (TOF), is thereafter obtained by converting the energy landscapes to reaction rate constants and solving equilibrium (or steady state) concentrations of the reacting species under predefined conditions such as temperature and gas pressures within a microkinetic model. The resulting activity plot (Figure 2) is a key tool for comparing catalyst candidates. 

Text BoxIn NOx converters, NO and NO2 are converted by a reducing agent. In the three-way automobile catalysts, this function is provided by species formed due to incomplete combustion such as CO and various hydrocarbons (HC). The end-product are the relatively harmless species N2, O2, H2O, and CO2. For automobiles, it is important that all these species are converted. Similarly, the ability to push towards more complete combustion is attractive also to aircrafts reducing soot and particulate formation as well as improving energy usage.[9] However, the conditions of an aircraft engine differ substantially (in terms of temperature, and temperature gradient, gas composition and velocity) from automobiles, why the analysis of the proper catalyst(s) in aircraft setting will have to be redone.  

To speed up the search for ideal catalyst, we will exploit adsorption energies of the anticipated key adsorbates such as N, C, and O from large databases augmented with machine learning methods.[10,11] We will search for monometallic and multimetallic catalysts. Mid- and high-entropy alloys, such as GRX-810, are particularly attractive as they can combine high-temperature stability with high catalytic activity.        

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

Milestone Q1: Determine reaction pathway of NOx conversion at operational conditions. 

   Success criteria: Reproduce reported energetics where applicable within ±0.2 eV. 

Milestone Q2: Establish property-activity relationship for subsequent catalysts screening.   

   Success criteria: Reproduce experimental rates (±102) for simulations on calibration system. 

Milestone Q3: Screen for mono- and bimetallic catalysts using available databases.  

   Success criteria: 100-1000 materials evaluated with 1-3 crystal surface orientations each. 

Milestone Q4: Co-optimize high entropy alloy catalyst with respect to durability, cost, and activity.  

   Success criteria: Combined with Q3, identify 1-4 promising catalyst candidates. 

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

Apart from proposing design strategies for aircraft NOx emission control, the successful project will generate a state-of-the art modeling framework and set the stage for research in several directions, internally within TTT and NASA but also with external partners. One future avenue is a continued evaluation of NOx emission control from jet engines in tandem with engine engineers and experimental investigations. With small modifications, the modeling framework will, in addition, be applicable to aircraft configurations using other propulsion systems. This includes the use of alternative fuels such as H2 or the use of electrical jet turbines powered by a centrally located combustion engine that would allow for better control of the emitted gases.[12–14]  

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

The two main risk predicted for this project are that i), the reaction network for the NOx abatement in generated from combustion of traditional jet fuels becomes overly complex to be properly addressed during the project; and ii), that the more detailed analysis suggests that the amount of abated NOx with the integrated catalytic converter will be insignificant. Both risks can be alleviated by switching to another (simplified) system. In case of i), the reaction system will be reduced to include NO and CO only (leaving the carbohydrates and NO2 aside). This will still allow for extraction of relevant results for the jet engine use case. In case of ii), a future engine design will be considered where the exhaust gas is separated from the jet stream allowing for longer catalyst contact time and enhanced degree of NOx conversion.

Title: Health Monitoring for Mechanical and Electrochemical Degradation in Structural Batteries.   

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).   

Text BoxBatteries are critical for powering future zero emissions vehicle concepts in the automotive, aerospace (e.g., urban air mobility, hybrid/all electric aircraft), industrial (e.g., autonomous drones), and consumer sectors (Figure 1 ​[1]​).  Recently, “massless” structural batteries have emerged that are capable of both supporting structural loads and storing energy​ [2]​.  They are called “massless” because they store energy in structures already needed in aircraft designs, thus no extra mass is required for separate battery storage.  The energy density and multifunctionality of structural batteries will allow a paradigm shift for electrical vehicle designs, leading to increased range and performance as well as a new generation of vehicle designs not possible using conventional batteries.  For these multifunctional battery structures to achieve their full potential, they must be used without external battery management systems.  At the same time, their safety must be guaranteed, especially for manned vehicle applications.  The proposed work aims to address safety assurances for future massless structural batteries by nondestructively studying mechanical and electrochemical degradation mechanisms in these newly developed batteries.  The ultimate goals of this work are (a) to build an understanding of the degradation mechanisms of massless structural batteries and (b) to establish and demonstrate inspection techniques that can be applied during operation to inform maintenance actions and grounding of aircraft before catastrophic failure.     

 

Health monitoring for batteries is important for their safe operation, especially in power-hungry electric aircraft where batteries are stressed through high discharge rates and extreme operating environments.  Battery health monitoring is a new field, with much of the focus in the research community on commercial lithium-ion battery chemistries and their state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC) (e.g., ​[3]​, ​[4]​).  Measurements of the SOC and SOH are meant to determine when batteries need to be changed, not on whether they are safe for operation.  On the other hand, NASA’s recent work under the CAS SPARRCI program sought to monitor the internal structure of batteries using resonance-based and guided wave ultrasonic methods ​[5]​.  The developments under SPARRCI included successful monitoring of structural resonance changes in lithium metal batteries during the electrochemical cycling process (Figure 2), as well as a demonstration of in-situ application of the developed techniques.  The resonance-based approaches identified under SPARRCI allow through-thickness structure and material property changes to be monitored, and guided wave approaches allow broad area coverage and localization of damage. 

 

Figure 2: Reflection coefficient spectrum measurements made on lithium metal pouch cell batteries at charge rates ranging from 0.1C to 0.5C, where 1C is the rate required to fully charge the battery in one hour.  Resonances are influenced by the layered structure and are shown as minima in the color maps.  The resonances shift toward lower frequencies during cell degradation.   

In the composite massless batteries that will be explored, the resonance-based methods (local) and guided wave methods (long range) will be applied to allow multi-scale monitoring of battery and structural health during mechanical and electrochemical cycling.  The work will leverage expertise developed in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of battery health within in LaRC’s Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Branch (NESB) as well as composite and battery fabrication expertise in LaRC’s Advanced Materials and Processing Branch.   

 

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

Production of composite structural batteries (Q1-Q2) – In-house expertise in composite processing and battery fabrication will be a key enabler of this milestone, as well as manufacturing methods developed within the research community (e.g.,​ [2]​).  At least 10 battery specimens with qualitatively similar electrochemical performance will be produced during this phase.  Performance will be verified through electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) after fabrication. 

Assembly and setup of measurement techniques on dummy specimens (Q1) – In parallel with battery fabrication, inert composite layups using the same materials and stacking sequences as structural batteries will be made without active electrochemical components.  These dummy specimens will allow rapid tuning of the inspection approaches and will reveal any potential issues with acoustic impedance mismatch and attenuation in dissimilar materials.  By the end of the first quarter, a baseline inspection capability will be ready for battery inspection.  Note that this is only possible in this short timeline because of the foundation laid through the CAS SPARRCI effort. 

Baseline measurements on batteries (Q2) – After fabricating battery specimens, baseline data will be collected before electrical cycling or mechanical loading.  These measurements will highlight the reproducibility of resonance and guided wave data among specimens and will be as a baseline to which the degraded response can be compared.   

Cycling and monitoring of batteries (Q2 – Q4) – Mechanical and electrochemical cycling of battery specimens will seed degradation that can be monitored using ultrasonic NDE approaches.   Electrical cycling will be conducted under constant current conditions to achieve a charge and discharge rate between 0.5C and 1C based on estimated cell capacities.  Three degradation scenarios will be examined: degradation due to electrical cycling alone, degradation due to mechanical loading alone, and combined mechanical loading with electrical cycling.    

Report Out (Q3 - Q4) – The novelty of the proposed work makes it viable for technical publication and dissemination to the research community.  In the last phase of the work, the team will output at least one (possibly more) technical publication in addition to a summary report for TTT.   
 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

The proposed work will lead to a TRL 4 demonstration of battery inspection techniques in relevant materials in a lab environment.  Both the mechanical and electrochemical loading scenarios will be simple in comparison to real-world operation.  In next steps, a database of degradation and sensor responses in more relevant operational conditions will be developed through random walk electrical cycling and vibration testing.  This data will be essential so that machine learning techniques can be trained and applied to structural-scale batteries to identify hazardous off-nominal conditions.  

The proposed effort works in synergy with NASA’s ongoing battery development and integrated vehicle health monitoring (IVHM) efforts.  Known transition paths include work under TTT for IVHM focused on sustainability, where these battery monitoring approaches could be another input into the framework for assessing vehicle health.  The work also supports structural composite battery development efforts within NASA and industry, where degradation mechanisms have not yet been explored.  

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

The highest technical risk in this work is in repeatable production of composite structural batteries and the ability to degrade them in a meaningful way for health monitoring technique development.  If in-house fabrication proves infeasible in three months, then the work would pivot to state-of-the-art commercial batteries.  High energy density lithium-ion batteries like those used in commercial drones or electric vehicles would be purchased and used as the primary test article during test execution.  Through this pivot, the work would bolster and further mature in situ health monitoring approaches for high energy batteries with nearer term application.  The transition paths supporting ongoing IVHM and battery development work would remain valid.

Title: Persistent Solar Power Station 

Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits).  Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you solving?  Has someone tried to solve this problem before?  Where did they go wrong?  What is different about your approach?  If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not?  How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools/methods or state-of-the art approaches?  If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is unattainable?

We are proposing a persistent high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) solar power station. The idea involves an airborne solar panel carried by two HALE aircraft operating at high altitude over a long duration. This is illustrated in the following figure. The electric propulsion on the HALE aircraft is powered by the energy harvested by the solar panel. The power provided by the solar panel can be beamed to UAM aircraft, enabling the aircraft to extend ranges and operate with more passenger capacity. The power can also be beamed to a ground station for energy storage. 

  

NASA Helios was a solar powered UAV designed by Aerovironment [1]. The first flight ended in a mishap. Subsequent investigations attributed one of the causes of the mishap to ""nonlinear stability and control problem involving complex interactions among the flexible structure, unsteady aerodynamics, flight control system, propulsion system, the environmental conditions, and vehicle flight dynamics."" As a result, the accident investigation board made several recommendations one of which is to ""Develop more advanced, multidisciplinary (structures, aeroelastic, aerodynamics, atmospheric, materials, propulsion, controls, etc) “time-domain” analysis methods appropriate to highly flexible, “morphing” vehicles."" 

 

The goal of the Helios was largely unfulfilled. If successful, it could have heralded in a new aerospace infrastructure program that could have wide ranging applications from providing power to internet services anywhere in the world.  

 

 

Persistent Solar Power Station 

 

The proposal is different from the Helios in the platform configuration. Applying the recommendations by the accident investigation board, the proposal will focus on developing new capabilities and better understanding of multidisciplinary interactions between nonlinear large deflection structure [2], aeroelasticity, unsteady aerodynamics, and flight control for highly flexible HALE aircraft. New capabilities could include structural dynamic tools, unsteady aerodynamic tools for large motion moving aerodynamic surfaces, and nonlinear aeroservoelasticity tools for flight dynamic prediction and flight control synthesis of HALE aircraft. These capabilities are not widely available. Some capabilities exist at universities, but they tend to be low-fidelity tools [3]. The ultimate goal is to achieve high-fidelity aeroservoelastic capabilities.

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

A tentative set of milestones are as follows: 

 

Month 1 - Concept development and vehicle sizing 

Month 4 - Finite-element model development for nonlinear large deflection structure of HALE aircraft 

Month 6 - Coupled structural dynamics - unsteady aerodynamic (fluid-structure interaction) simulation 

Month 8 - Nonlinear aeroservoelastic model development for flight dynamics and control 

Month 10 - Flight control design for high altitude gust rejection, modal suppression, and station keeping 

Month 12 - Final report submission 

 

The metrics for evaluating the proposed work will be new capabilities and tools that can predict nonlinear aeroelasticity for large deflection structures with wing tip displacement at least 20% of the semi-span. Additionally, metrics for flight control will be used to evaluate the gust disturbance rejection, modal suppression, and station keeping to maintain precise altitude and orientation to within certain specifications. 

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

 

If successful, the immediate next step would involve identifying a potential project (TTT) for transition and briefing to industry (e.g., Aerovironment).  The follow-on research would include: low-speed wind tunnel test at university facility (e.g. University of Washington) on a highly flexible aircraft model with active control surfaces, developing higher fidelity tools for nonlinear aeroelasticity, FSI, and aeroservoelasticity. 

 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

The proposed work is considered highly challenging. Time constraint will play a major role in the success of the project, but if this constraint is removed, then some measure of success will likely be realized by means of having new tools and capabilities. Thus, the technical risk is likely be driven by the schedule. It is possible that not all objectives as proposed can be realized in the time frame. From the operational perspective, the key is to determine feasibility of the concept in terms of flight dynamics, stability, and control. It is possible that the flight control could be very challenging and success criteria could not be met. If so, resizing the aerodynamic configuration to increase stability and structure to increase rigidity may be required. This could potentially increase the aircraft weight and thereby lead to increased power requirements. The flight control challenge might be reduced but the benefit might decrease as well. ",,,,,,,,,
Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts,TTT Green Aviation,,"TRANSFORMATIONAL TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT 

FY24 GREEN AVIATION PROPOSAL TEMPLATE 

Title: Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts 

Problem description, objectives, approach, and anticipated benefits 

 

Large electrified aircraft produce orders of magnitude more electronics heat than even the most advanced electrical systems on current aircraft. More heat means more drag on ram-air heat exchangers (HXs), which are the existing state of the art for aircraft heat rejection. Ram-air HXs sized for electrified aircraft could create so much drag and weight that they could negate the benefits from electrification [1,2]. A HX that not only eliminates drag but creates thrust would solve this problem. 

Text BoxThere has been a renewed interest in thrust-producing HXs via the Meredith effect [3,4,5]. Meredith effect HXs were previously used in some WWII-era piston engine aircraft, like the P-51 Mustang. Current passenger aircraft do not utilize these designs because jet engines naturally have higher air cooling. Additionally, engine oil heat is typically used to pre-heat the fuel or is rejected via a surface heat exchanger installed in the bypass duct rather than in a standalone duct. However large electrified aircraft likely cannot rely completely on surface (or outer mold line) heat exchangers and will need to reject heat via a pumped-fluid loop to a ram-air heat exchanger [6,7]. The majority of proposed electrified aircraft architectures utilize a single-phase pumped fluid loop [8] operating at temperatures up to 200 °C, which makes them an ideal candidate for a Meredith effect HX. The recent analytical work has shown the potential for thrust production in electrified aircraft HX ducts, however, to date there is little to no evidence that any designs have been built or tested. 

The proposed work would determine the feasibility of a thrust-producing HX for a hybrid-electric aircraft in realistic operating conditions, evaluating potential thrust vs. rejection temperature. This would involve sizing and optimization of the ducted HX at each rejection temperature. If thrust can be produced at a reasonable rejection temperature, a sub-scale HX core would be built and tested at design and off-design operating conditions to measure generated thrust. The HX itself would be of the microchannel type, which have been shown to have higher performance and lower drag and compared to the typical plate-fin heat exchangers used in aviation [9]. The HX would utilize additive manufacturing techniques, which can create the complex microchannel structures more easily and affordably then traditional chemical etching and diffusion bonding processes. HX materials to be investigated include metals as well as plastics, which have recently shown potential benefits in a number of different heat exchanger applications [10,11]. If successful, this work would demonstrate light-weight and zero net drag thermal management which is an enabling technology for NASA’s long-term goals of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation. 

 

Milestones 

 

Month 1-3: Heat exchanger and duct analysis and optimization to determine feasibility of thrust production at realistic single-aisle hybrid-electric aircraft operating conditions 

Month 4-9: Selection of heat exchanger design. Design and procurement of test rig for measuring thrust. Procurement/fabrication of heat exchanger. 

Month 10-12: Testing of heat exchanger. Documentation of results. 

 

Transition Plan and Follow-On Research 

 

After this work is completed, next steps would be integration into an electrified powertrain thermal management system, such as the one being developed under the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions: Subsonic Single Aft Engine project (CAS/SUSAN). Potential follow-on research could include evaluation of methods to increase HX rejection temperatures if this research determines that is desirable. Such methods could include integration of a heat pump or engine heat source. Other follow-on research could include investigating HX designs that are integrated into electric fan ducts, as that has been shown to have greater performance than standalone ducts in certain conditions [4]. 

 

Pivot Plan 

 

If the initial approach is not feasible, it would likely be because the needed rejection temperature is higher than the typical temperature limits for electrified aircraft components. In that case, thrust production would not occur, but drag reduction could still be demonstrated and measured. Alternatively, a heat pump system could be sized and optimized to generate the needed higher rejection temperatures. Testing could still occur without a heat pump, as the fluid temperatures would be provided by the test rig fluid system or by integrated heating elements.

Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems: Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation,TTT Green Aviation,,"Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems: Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation 

 

The rapid advancement of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology has revolutionized the aviation industry. However, traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms pose significant limitations, including noise pollution, low energy efficiency, and limited maneuverability. These issues are especially evident in residential settings and sensitive environments where noise and emissions are disruptive. While space exploration has widely adopted ion propulsion, terrestrial applications, particularly in UAS, remain under-explored due to challenges like atmospheric drag. Nonetheless, the promise of silent operations, zero emissions, and minimized waste offers a tantalizing prospect for green aviation. Advances by organizations like Undefined Technologies² and MIT³ have proven the viability of IPS for Earth-bound applications. 

This project aims to develop a sustainable alternative to conventional UAS propulsion mechanisms by integrating ion propulsion systems (IPS), a technology deeply rooted in space exploration, into UAS. This innovative approach promises significant advancements in UAS propulsion, including reduced noise and emissions, enhanced energy efficiency, and increased maneuverability. The project will begin with a comprehensive literature review to assess the current state of the art in ion propulsion systems (IPS) technology and its potential applicability to UAS. This review will inform the development of a specialized sensor system and the integration of a deep learning system directly into the IPS. This innovative approach will ensure that UAS not only benefit from sustainable propulsion but also gain from superior diagnostics and efficiency. In addition, the project will incorporate a Multi-Sensor Perception System (MsPs) that uses neuromorphic-computing-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) to provide real-time feedback on the performance of the IPS and develop advanced diagnostic and predictive maintenance algorithms. 

The successful integration of IPS into UAS is expected to have a profound impact on UAS applications across multiple sectors. By significantly reducing noise and emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency and maneuverability, IPS-powered UAS will open up new possibilities for UAS operations in residential zones and other environmentally sensitive areas. This project has the potential to revolutionize the UAS industry by addressing the key limitations of traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms. The successful integration of IPS into UAS will herald a new era of sustainable, efficient, and maneuverable UAS operations. 

In addition to the aforementioned benefits, IPS-powered UAS could also offer significant advantages in terms of cost and safety. IPS systems are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and operate, and they pose a lower risk of fire or explosion than traditional UAS propulsion systems. These factors make IPS an attractive option for a wide range of UAS applications, including commercial deliveries, disaster relief, and environmental monitoring. 

 

A comprehensive literature review will be conducted to assess the current state of the art in ion propulsion systems, UAS technologies, and neuromorphic computing. This review will identify key advancements in each area and highlight potential synergies. The review will also identify any gaps in the current knowledge base that need to be addressed. 

Upon completion of the literature review, the team will develop a detailed design for downscaling the IPS to operate on UAS and for modifying the UAS to work with the IPS. They will also develop a prototype for the MsPs, which will be based on sensors developed at GRC for the Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS)¹, such as the Retarding Potential Analyzer (RPA), planar probe (PP), Discharge current sensor, and Wide-Angle Potential Analyzer (WAPA). The MsPs will be designed to integrate neuromorphic computing principles and ensure compatibility with the IPS. Key metrics for this phase include the design's adaptability, energy efficiency, and compatibility with UAS structures. 

Concurrently, a deep learning core will be implemented on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This core will be responsible for analyzing data from the MsPs and optimizing and diagnosing the performance of the ion propulsion system. The efficiency and accuracy of the core, along with its speed and energy efficiency, will be critical. 

Once the MsPs and the deep learning core have been developed, they will be integrated and tested in controlled environments to ensure system stability and accuracy. Field testing will then be conducted using UAS equipped with the developed system in real-world conditions to gather pertinent data. Based on the field test insights, refinements will be made to the system to enhance efficiency and address any identified gaps. 

Upon completion of the field testing, comprehensive documentation detailing the project, methodologies, and findings will be prepared for various stakeholders. This documentation will include recommendations for future research based on the project's results. 

The project's success will be evaluated based on factors such as innovation, tangible impacts, efficiency, feedback from stakeholders, and scalability. An expert panel will be assembled for a holistic evaluation, with feedback recorded for future reference and ongoing refinement. 

 

Upon successful prototyping and validation in UAS, this technology has the potential to be scaled for broader applications, such as larger unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and piloted aircraft. As the neuromorphic-based DNN control system proves its worth, efforts would be directed towards enhancing its computational prowess, response times, and adaptability, with potential extensions into other aerospace or ground-based vehicular systems. 

The broader ecosystem in which UAS operate will also be refined, with emphasis on optimized flight paths, charging facilities, and the incorporation of renewable energy resources, which could play a significant role in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) development. The shift towards sustainability might also lead to explorations in other green aviation facets like sustainable materials, advanced traffic management, and contrail management, possibly resulting in partnerships with industries centered on green airport infrastructure. 

As the system evolves, there would be opportunities to leverage richer training datasets to refine the DNN's diagnostic accuracy, making it suitable for commercial UAS maintenance and predictive services. The energy efficiency of ion propulsion paves the way for potential alliances with the renewable energy sector, emphasizing solar, wind, or other green energy sources, culminating in a fully green UAS operation. 

Subsequent research could delve into alternative ion propulsion techniques, advanced energy storage solutions, revamped safety protocols, and integration with emerging technologies like quantum computing. Additionally, considering the societal and regulatory implications of such technological advancements would be crucial. 

Ultimately, this venture marks the onset of an evolutionary phase in green aviation and computational paradigms, paving the way for a sustainable aerospace future. 

 

 

Should technical infeasibility be encountered, a thorough review meeting will be convened with all stakeholders to understand the root causes of the challenges, pinpoint impacted project components, and re-evaluate the project's overall feasibility. Following this, there will be a realignment of objectives, potentially modifying certain facets of the approach to ensure project viability. If ion propulsion as a core technology proves untenable, parallel technologies or alternative energy sources, such as electrohydrodynamic (EHD) propulsion or hybrid systems, could be explored to maintain the commitment to green aviation. Regardless of propulsion setbacks, the potential of the Multi-Sensor Perception System (MsPs) and its neuromorphic-computing-based DNN remains significant; pivoting attention to these systems could enhance other green aviation technologies. 

To address challenges, collaborations with academic institutions or industry experts may offer fresh perspectives, and iterative prototyping could lead to gradual refinements. If the team identifies knowledge gaps, short-term training or even onboarding temporary experts will be prioritized. Maintaining transparency with all stakeholders, including the funding agency, is crucial to ensure trust and potentially gain additional insights or resources. 

In conclusion, while technical challenges are formidable, they can spur innovation. With flexibility, collaboration, and unwavering commitment, the team remains dedicated to the vision of sustainable UAS propulsion, regardless of the path taken.

As aviation moves to new propulsion technologies, fuels as well as airframes there will be a need to restructure the layout. The current tube and wing design has fuel tanks conveniently located in the wings taking advantage of the available volume as well as providing additional structural support. For airframes such as truss braced wings and blended wing bodies; propulsion systems such as high voltage hybrid electric and fuel cells;  as well as fuels such as hydrogen, it may no longer be feasible or desirable to maintain the current configuration. Conformal storage tanks are a potential solution as they can increase the packing efficiency in the available volume for odd shaped volumes. For maximum weight efficiency they need to be integrated with the airframe’s load carrying paths. This however poses design and manufacturing challenges. Odd shaped conformal tanks are not as amenable to conventional automated composite layup approaches as simpler geometries. This necessitates design compromises or the use of hand layup procedures which impact throughput, product consistency and ultimately the cost of new aircraft and transition to greener aviation. 

We therefore propose investigating manufacturing approaches for the design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for conformal tanks to provide both the structural support, fuel holding capacity and slosh prevention while meeting the constraints of the volume available in the new airframes. We propose utilizing high performance carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers as the primary reinforcement for the conformal tanks. Highly flexible, high strength CNT fibers with tight bend radii and high knot efficiency are amenable to automated 3D weaving into complex geometries. These geometries can be optimized for both the fuel carrying, and load path requirements for the conformal tanks. 3D weaving also enables building the structural supports for slosh prevention baffles in the preforms. CNT fibers are macroscopic materials assembled from a hierarchical arrangement of nanotubes.  While still in development, they are now available in lengths and strengths that have enabled demonstration of lined and linerless pressure vessels as well as structural panels for the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Office and other customers [1]. 

 

Conformal tanks have a long history of use as a space saving design. In automotives, conformal tanks are used to store windshield-washer fluid and over-flow coolant from radiators [2]. They have also long been considered for spacecraft for their potential weight savings, volume use optimization and placement flexibility [2-5]. Aircraft, specifically military aircraft, have also used conformal tanks for extension of their range and more flexibility in mounting other payloads.  Manufacturing challenges have thus far limited their wider usage in aircraft (and spacecraft) applications. 

 

3D weaving of fibers has started to gain wider use as an enabling technology for creating complex shapes. An example is the Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) where, in partnership with industry, NASA has been developing Thermal Protection System (TPS) technology to enable landing of large payloads on other planets [6]. 

 

Combined, 3D weaving of CNT preforms for conformal composite tanks could lead to manufacturing friendly lightweight structures that integrate well into the airframe for greater performance and reduced environmental impact. 

 

Specifically, we propose to investigate: 

Achieving the benefits of conformal tanks and structure in green aviation using Systems Analysis 

Approaches to the design and manufacturing of structural preforms made from 3D weaving of CNTs for tailored conformal tanks that meet the airframe requirements.  

Testing that would be required to support future article fabrication and evaluation.  Complex geometry of conformal tanks means none trivial and varied boundary load cases.

Problem and Objectives:  

Air traffic is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming due to the formation of contrails via aircraft emissions. Contrails typically occur at or above 20,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and constitute about 35% of aviation’s global warming effects [1]. As the aviation industry continues to grow, the need for efficient contrail mitigation strategies may be required for greater environmental sustainability. Over the years, many contrail mitigation strategies have been developed which involve both heading and altitude changes [2]. These works often provide trade-off values between fuel consumption and contrail reduction. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is very little research over the impact of widespread adoption of such strategies on a network-wide, large-scale operation; existing works only consider strategies for a single flight. For instance, contrail mitigation strategies may lead to greater air traffic density especially with existing ATC (air traffic control) instructions such as holding, flow control, and demand-capacity balancing [3].Thus, the objective of this proposed study is to gain a better understanding of the effects of adopting any given contrail mitigation strategy on an existing airspace network. The specific aims of this study are the following: 

Develop a novel and efficient contrail mitigation strategy based on recent artificial intelligence and search-based techniques for simultaneous flights, rather than just one. 

Examine the aggregate impact a given contrail mitigation strategy would have on an existing airspace network within a simulated environment. Impacts can be measured in the form of sector demand or departure delay and will be assessed by comparing the use and lack of use of a mitigation strategy. 

Approach:  

In the field of Air Traffic Control (ATC) most mission-planning can be classified as either strategic or tactical which is linked to either pre-flight or during flight optimization. Our work will focus on investigating pre-flight or strategic flight optimizations in which we seek to create an optimal flight trajectory for a jet-based aircraft while avoiding creating a contrail as it flies from one airport to another. Tactical or during flight optimization will be a support role in our investigation and might become more relevant when last minute maneuvers are needed to avoid flying into a contrail region. 

To verify the efficacy of our approach, we will apply it different aircraft-types with different aircraft performance specifications such as (regional aircraft, business jets, commercial aircraft), and new entrants such as supersonic passenger aircraft. We plan on using an open-source flight simulator called BlueSky [4, 4] to model the physics of various aircraft and incorporate Breakthrough Energy's open-source contrail models [5] into BlueSky. Simulating the physics-based contrail models alongside BlueSky's flight simulator allows us to test and refine different trajectory optimization methods and discover which approaches might work or need to be improved to perform contrail avoidance and mitigation per different aircraft and missions. 

By comparing different trajectory optimization methods in BlueSky, we will be able to simulate and perform studies on how these new flights will defer from current day-to-day missions. If flights start flying these new mission-optimal routes that avoid regions with high humidity and below freezing temperatures in the airspace that might lead to the creation of contrails [2], then how much of an impact does this have on flight time, energy use, and other optimization parameters compared to current day-to-day missions? These are some questions we hope to address in our studies. 

The novelty of this work is twofold: (1) to design and investigate which trajectory-based optimization methods work for performing contrail avoidance and mitigation per aircraft type and mission profiles; and (2) perform simulation studies for these mission-optimal contrail avoiding aircraft flying in the airspace and how much it would differ or affect the current state-of-the-art aircraft operations. In the second part, we can investigate many different scenarios such as how much extra time these contrail avoiding aircraft will add to their original missions, which aircraft need to avoid contrail regions and which do not, and how will contrail avoidance work with supersonics. Some of these questions have been addressed in prior works but we are proposing an all-encompassing solution metric study and investigate newer aircraft such as supersonics.  

Benefits: 

We advance the state-of-the-art twofold: (1) in flight trajectory optimization by exploring existing and designing new trajectory optimization approaches and incorporate novel contrail avoidance criteria to these methods, and (2) in the ATC realm where we analyze the effect of different missions and aircraft types performing these mission-optimal trajectory-based methods with contrail mitigation. The proposed work will provide several benefits for the public: (1) a contrail model add-on to BlueSky for enabling others to perform contrail detection and avoidance, (2) identify mission-optimal aircraft trajectory optimization methods with contrail avoidance and mitigation, and (3) provide a metric study which analyzes the effects of each different contrail avoidance method.

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

Next steps and Follow-on research: 

The adoption of contrail mitigation strategies is not widespread due to poor understanding of the greater impacts on existing aviation operations. We envision that more investigation in developing these optimal flight trajectories while avoiding contrail regions in the airspace is needed. In addition, it would be a benefit to perform studies on an air traffic management (ATM) system where we can study the aggregate effect of multiple aircraft interacting with each other while avoiding contrails. Other steps are in more research applying machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning and using neural networks.  

 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

One area where we can always pivot is in using another flight simulation software if BlueSky does not work as intended, and we can then try to integrate Breakthrough Energy’s models or create our own python contrail models based on what is currently published by the research community in scientific journals. The second is related to research and is naturally addressed due to the set-up of the proposal, we aim to investigate several methods for performing trajectory optimization while avoiding creating contrail. We may have to experiment with combining and mixing different flight optimization strategies and possibly consider hypothetical aircraft flight performance specifications to enable certain flight maneuvers. These in turn may provide data or insight into the design of newer aircraft types.

Discharge Mitigation and Current Mapping
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you
solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What is
different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why not? How

Aircraft have traditionally used 28 volts for power distribution, but newer aircraft are beginning to use
270 volts. The first all-electric aircraft are using voltages of up to about 500; however, designers who are
looking at megawatt-class electrified-propulsion systems for single-aisle airliners propose up to 3,000
volts and up to 2000 amps.
At such high currents, buckles in cabling and defects in the conductor material can cause unwanted heat
sinks that can destroy cables. Also, high voltages in the reduced air pressure at the cruising altitudes of
commercial aircraft could lead to a potentially hazardous phenomenon known as partial discharge.
Partial discharge occurs when a current breaches the gap between two points with a voltage differential
across or through an insulation (micron level or smaller in size). These gaps, or voids, are typically air
bubbles within the wire’s insulation that occur during wire/cable fabrication. The voltage differential
between the two points creates an electric field inside the gap polarizing the air molecules within. As the
electric field grows stronger, the molecules within the insulation gap are more apt to collide and ionize,
that is, to become either positively or negatively charged due to the loss or gain of an electron,
respectively. Mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before experiencing a collision
(i.e., the average distance any air molecule in the insulation gap will travel before hitting another.) At
high altitudes (low-pressure), despite fewer collisions, the longer mean free path allows the particles to
accelerate over a greater distance and collide with significantly greater kinetic energy. These higher
energy collisions are more likely to facilitate ionization. So new cabling designs and insulation systems
will have to be developed to avoid such hazards.
Current state-of-the-art for high-current measurement breaking the circuit or magnetic induction
(NDG.io). Breaking the circuit at such high currents can add unwanted high failure connection points.
Magnetic induction technology measures the induced current produced by the magnetic field generated 
from cable current. While this a much better way, the induction method is too inaccurate (not greater
than 2%, 40 amp difference at 2000 amps) for aircraft precision, much too bulky to get between cabling,
and are only rated up to 600 amps. Much less than many MW aircraft are projected to require. Even if
all these issues for both methods could be solved, both approaches average out spatial variations and
therefore cannot distinguish the contributions of bulk processes and edge effects or defect-induced
contributions, which are of crucial importance to understanding local current densities in the cabling at
different points.
Current state-of-the-art detection of partial/coronal discharge utilize micro-sonics. One technique uses a
mini network of micro-acoustic cameras to digitally visualize the minute vibrations from breaking the
insulation (Flir). These devices allow a spatial imaging of the conductor and where the breaking is
occurring visually. Another technique uses opto-acoustic imaging through fiber optic cabling (Optics11).
These devices detect the acoustic emission signals of partial discharges and tracks their evolution over
time with fiber optic partial discharge (PD) sensors. The measuring principle behind the fiber optic PD
sensor is based on the acoustic emission technology. Both technologies are a bit expensive yet work well
at detecting partial discharges in high-voltage environments. However, both technologies require microvibrations of an insulation breach or beginnings of the discharge to have anything to detect. By this time
the cable would already be compromised and in need in need of replacement. This may be fine for an
electrical ground station but not an aircraft 30,000 ft in the air full of passengers.
This project aims to create very low SWaP, nano/micro scale magnetic field sensor to measure these
minute magnetic fields and field gradients created by the moving charges in aircraft cabling using ionic
defects in Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices as atomic-scale magnetometers. These sensors would be able to
detect currently accurately, but also determine current vector and deliver spatial current density
measurements. This would allow for accurate hot-spot detection in conductors well before an issue is
created. In high-voltage situation these sensors could measure buildup of charge due to voids or points
in high voltage insulation via their minute magnetic field gradients produced through moving charges.
This would allow for detection of an incurring PD well before it has begun and will allow for diagnosis of
what stage it is in well before the breach. This technology works by using the electronic resonance of an
electron of an implanted defect in a biased-SiC device as an absolute magnetometer. The magnetic
fields are measured as a perturbation of the electronic resonance of the system where magnetic field
intensity, vector, and current density can be derived. This work is early TRL, however, we have built an
initial quantum magnetometry apparatus and have demonstrated the ability to achieve resonance. An
acceptance from this call would allow for completion to the next steps in device realization for future
clean, green aviation systems monitoring.
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion.
1. Charge transport models will be produced in COMSOL. 2. Characterization of Defects will be done
using Electrically Detected Magnetic Resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy. 3. Device sensitivity will be
determined experimentally, and the theoretical limit will be determined through modeling. 4.
Demonstration of minute magnetic field measurement via defects in SiC will be completed.
This work should be evaluated based on whether the system has the capability to measure minute
changes in magnetic fields, needed sensitivities are determined to measure precursors of partial
discharge and current density in conductors, and device theoretical sensitivity has been determined to
be able to meet these requirements when full device is realized.
3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the potential areas
for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
The next steps would be to optimize efficiency, speed, and sensitivity. Then, the miniaturization of the
non-chip laboratory components to chip-scale would come next. Some of this work would be done in
tandem. As of right now, we are adding a preamp on chip which would eliminate the need for off chip
preamplification.
The most reasonable transition for this work would be to be absorbed into a larger project focused on
electric engines and magnetic materials. The continuance of this work would not require huge amounts
of capital to continue so it would not burden a large or medium program at all.
Continued work in understanding the manifestation of partial discharge could be done. Also,
understanding of generation and dynamics of magnetic domain walls at nano scale in nanocrystalline
metal (NSM) materials could be done with these devices. These materials are essential to switching in
electric engines. Because of the much larger power and rate that would be needed for electric aviation
than cars, new more efficient switching materials are much needed for future aviation.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three months
into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is
not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot? What
alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
With 9 months still available, there would be much time to pivot. Each milestone has a contingency if
not providing results in a reasonable amount of time. The only real possibilities of issue would be
milestones 3 and 4. Characterization of the defect type would be initially done by Random Telegraph
Signal (RTS) analysis. The RTS is characterized by a well-defined current amplitude between the
high and low level and the average times in the high and low levels following a Poissonian distribution.
Spectroscopic information about the defect responsible for the observed RTS is usually extracted by
observing the dependence of the capture and emission time constants on temperature. If that has
issues, we will do to another method. The onset of RTS with increasing forward bias is accompanied by
the onset of electroluminescence (EL). We would employ a method to use photonics to observe the
luminescent response with change in bias. If there is an issue with this method, we would employ deeplevel transient spectroscopy (DTLS). This would require an augmentation of our setup so this would be
the last step to employ if all fails.
We need to be able to demonstrate the measurement of minute magnetic fields to calibrate detector,
demonstrate principle, and find theoretical limits to complete this year’s work. So, we will apply three
methods to ascertain the needed parameters. If one fails or does not work, we can average it out. The
lock-in output of the spin resonance signal is approximately the first derivative of the Lorentzian or
Gaussian broadened lineshape, which provides a linear response between the signal amplitude and
magnetic field near resonance. As such, the sensitivity of an EDMR-based sensor is proportional to the
signal linewidth and amplitude. The first method assumes an electrical shot-noise limited sensitivity,
which can be simply calculated using EDMR spectrum. The second method outlined in performs a FFT on
the time trace of the lock-in output at the zero-crossing point of the spin resonance response. The last
method applies a square wave modulated external magnetic field of alternating polarity and a histogram
of the lock-in output time trace is used to determine the standard deviation to calculate the sensitivity.
These methods would be applied in order.",,,,,,,,,

Title: High-speed thermometry tool development to assess alternative propulsion technologies
1. Provide a description of the work (describe problem, objectives, approach, and anticipated
benefits). Address any or all of the following questions (if relevant): What problem are you
solving? Has someone tried to solve this problem before? Where did they go wrong? What
is different about your approach? If no one has attempted to solve this problem before, why
not? How does your proposed work transform current capabilities, tools/methods or stateof-the art approaches? If successful, what does your proposed work enable that currently is
unattainable? Please include references/citations to back up claims where appropriate.
Obtaining temperature measurements within the high-temperature and high-pressure
environments of aviation gas turbine test rigs are extremely challenging due to their harsh
environment. Traditional instrumentation such as thermocouple probes do not typically survive
within such environments or are limited to wall-based measurements only. Laser-based, nonintrusive measurements are considered to be ideal within such environments and indeed their
developments within research laboratories have intensified over the past 2-3 decades. Nevertheless,
quantitative measurements within such environments often create their own challenges. An example
of such a measurement challenge would be solid tracer particles introduced into the flow for particle
imaging velocimetry or phosphor thermography fouling windows, thereby limited the life of the
experimental hardware and reducing the utility of such measurements.
Molecular-based measurements on the other hand, especially those that rely on the gas-phase
spectroscopic properties of targeted species, are ideally suited for such environments as they do not
require a physical probe or tracer particles. Among the different measurement tools available within
this category, the proposed work would develop high-speed (10-100 kHz), spatially resolved, 2D
planar temperature measurements of specific targeted molecules using planar laser-induced
fluorescence (PLIF). The targeted molecules would primarily be flame gas radicals naturally present
within the combustion chamber and downstream sections of alternative propulsion systems for
aviation. Such measurements can provide particularly rich insight within the flame zone, as different
radicals such as OH for hydrogen-air propulsion systems or NH for ammonia-air propulsion systems
can be targeted. Temperature measurements within such environments have the potential to provide
crucial insight into the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and other key pollutants, especially in terms of
their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Furthermore, the NO molecule can also be directly
targeted for measurements of temperature and perhaps concentration using planar laser-induced 
fluorescence if enough NO were to be present in the flame gas (> 100 ppm). These temperature
measurements would be used by engine designers and combustion engineers performing CFD
simulations. Time-resolved measurements would enable the validation of modern computer codes,
such as large eddy simulations (LES).
The proposed work leverages recent developments in burst-mode laser and optical parametric
oscillator technology, including those supported by recent NASA SBIR and NSTGRO awards, to
facilitate such a temperature measurement at high repetition-rates. The state-of-the-art for such
measurements, especially within harsh practical environments, requires using two complex laser
systems simultaneously while being limited to a repetition-rate of 10 Hz. In contrast, the proposed
work utilizes the wavelength flexibility of the burst-mode laser with the wavelength tunability of the
optical parametric oscillator to provide a two-wavelength temperature measurement at 1,000-10,000
times the standard repetition rate. This proposal heavily leverages the state-of-the-art laser and
camera systems recently acquired by researchers in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems
Branch within the NASA Langley Research Directorate. By utilizing the recent technology investments
already undertaken by NASA, the current proposal can provide critical support to improve the TRL of
this measurement technology so that it can be applied within areas of critical ARMD needs such as
green aviation. NASA programs supporting the next generation designs of gas turbine engines, along
with government collaborators such as the Department of Energy and industry partners such as
General Electric, would benefit from this temperature measurement tool development.
2. Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon
completion.
The primary objectives of the proposal research is to demonstrate spatially resolved, 2D planar
temperature measurements of selected species at a repetition-rate of 10-100 kHz for burst durations
of 2-10 ms. Nominal field-of-view for the 2D measurement plane is approximately 100 mm x 100 mm,
with a typical spatial resolution on the order of 0.1 mm. This effort strongly leverages recent SBIR
efforts supported by researchers in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems Branch at NASA
Langley. The first task for the project would be to complete a literature review on two-line
temperature measurements for candidate molecules within flames such as OH, NH, and NO. Based
on this literature review, one molecule will be down selected for the Year 1 investigation. Work in
the laboratory will be performed for the rest of the year, with the key intermediary reporting
milestones being characterization of the measurement sub-systems and initial temperature
measurements. An end-of-year report would provide a summary of the entire effort for the project,
including data for high-speed temperature measurements with estimated uncertainties within a labscale environment. The end of year report would also provide an evaluation of the measurement
capability for optically accessible combustion test rigs and the proposed way forward to further
develop this research for deployment within an engine-relevant configuration. A summary of the
anticipated milestones is provided in the table below.

3. After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps? Where are the
potential areas for transition? What follow-on research do you anticipate?
The proposed research effort is highly crosscutting as it focuses on the measurement tool
development for high-speed temperature measurements within alternative propulsion systems.
Following successful Year 1 demonstration efforts, Year 2+ efforts may focus on the further
development of the tool through application within increasingly realistic environments relevant to the
combustor or downstream sections of an alternative propulsion system. The grand challenge of such
development efforts would be a demonstration of such measurements within an optically accessible
gas turbine test rig at the Glenn Research Center operating with hydrogen-air, ammonia-air, or
another alternative aviation fuel. The windowed test rigs at Glenn are well suited for these
measurements, as optical access from two orthogonal windows are typically required for PLIF.
Indeed, researchers such as R.J. Locke and Y.R. Hicks from Glenn have performed laser-based
measurements within such facilities over the years. However, neither high-speed PLIF flow
visualization nor PLIF thermometry has been performed at these facilities to the best of my
knowledge. The work could also be extended in future years to study contrail formation in sooting
flames, which would utilize other laser-based diagnostics methods such as laser-induced
incandescence (LII) while leveraging the same burst-mode laser system.
4. Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation: Three
months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial
proposed approach is not feasible technically. You still have 9 months of funding remaining,
how do you pivot? What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?
The planned effort of detailed literature review and down-selection of the target flame molecule
provides a perfect opportunity to evaluate the technical feasibility of the proposed approach. For the
proposed effort we plan to use a two-wavelength thermometry approach for 10-100 kHz temperature
measurements. Such an approach requires two laser wavelengths to be carefully selected and may
limit the dynamic range of the measurement. In the event that this approach would be deemed not
technically feasible, one potential pivot would be to incorporate a four-wavelength thermometry
approach. Such an approach would leverage the developments in burst-mode laser architecture
recently performed by an NSTGRO Fellow who is part of the Advanced Measurements and Data
Systems Branch at NASA Langley. In short, the alternative approach would modify the laser
architecture to provide a group of four laser pulses at four different wavelengths, rather than a pair
of laser pulses at two different wavelengths, while maintaining the overall measurement repetitionrate of 10-100 kHz. Two different measurement schemes could be utilized based on this approach:
1) a four-line temperature measurement probing four different absorption transitions or 2) a fourcolor temperature measurement where two of the laser wavelengths correspond to the peak of two
different transitions and the other two wavelengths are slightly detuned from their respective peaks.
The flexibility of the laser system that we propose to use in this work enables one to easily pivot
towards more technically feasible approaches as the need potentially arises.",,,,,,,,,

Description of Proposed Work: 

NASA is seeking sustainable solutions for aviation to achieve zero-emission beyond 2040. Electrification of aircraft is critical to achieve this goal. A key component for electric aviation, if not the most important one, is the energy storage device that is not only capable of powering the aircraft (i.e., high energy, high power), but also safe to fly. LI-air batteries are widely considered the most energy-dense energy storage platform yet the most challenging to develop. A Li-air battery pack has potential to achieve ultrahigh specific energy >1000 Wh/kg that is unattainable with any other battery chemistry. Successful development would be transformational and may enable 737-type short haul or even long haul electric aircraft. 

While NASA has several previous projects on Li-air batteries, they ended with either the lack of required performance metrics or transition opportunities. There has been recent refocus on aviation batteries, with substantial development in energy storage materials and deeper understanding in safe, high energy battery concepts. We herein propose, as a seedling effort, the re-invention toward a new generation of Li-air batteries. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of combined use of solid electrolyte with holey graphene air cathode for high specific energy Li-oxygen batteries and to project a credible path toward the full development of a 1000 Wh/kg battery pack. The key aspects of our approach are: 

Explore the use of solid electrolyte instead of conventional liquid electrolyte in the battery cells. As such, the Li-air batteries will become non-flammable. 

With the use of oxygen from Earth atmosphere as the cathodic reactant, Li-air batteries are intrinsically the most sustainable option among all battery platforms.  

With our proven holey graphene air cathode platform (developed by PI) ultrahigh specific energy beyond 1000 Wh/kg at the pack level may be achievable.  

 

Successful execution of this seedling project would be the first step toward the most disruptive solution and the holy grail for aviation batteries that may enable 737-type large aircraft with all-electric propulsion, for which no other solutions currently exist.  

Background: 

Recently, our team has been investigating a solid-state lithium-sulfur battery system in the CAS/TTT project “SABERS” (“Solid-state Architecture Batteries for Enhanced Rechargeability and Safety”), which may enable a non-flammable battery system with specific energy of 500 Wh/kg. If successful, SABERS could enable safe battery packs that can power commuter-level vehicles. With low-cost elemental sulfur as the active cathodic reactant, SABERS is also considered a sustainable solution in comparison to state-of-the-art Li ion chemistries where expensive transition metal oxides are used, along with their serious supply chain risks.  

SABERS team has made significant progress and recently demonstrated experimentally a feasible path to achieve the above goals. However, larger future vehicles, such as 737-type electric aircraft, would require much higher specific energy at 1000 Wh/kg level, with equal (if not higher) requirement in the safety and rechargeability, among other criteria. While conventional lithium-ion chemistry has a specific energy limit in the vicinity of 300 Wh/kg, the use of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) chemistry in SABERS could double that amount. We recently projected that SABERS bipolar solid-state battery stacks may achieve around 700 Wh/kg with perfect S utilization, but practically in the range of 550-600 Wh/kg considering the realistic kinetic electrochemical efficiency in terms of S conversion. While this surpasses the goal of SABERS, the gap toward 1000 Wh/kg for future aviation remains substantial. The lithium-sulfur chemistry is therefore at its limit. 

Lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) electrochemistry is also known as “Li-air batteries” as the oxygen is expected to be spontaneously extracted from air. Li-O2 battery system has an extraordinary high theoretical specific energy (~12000 Wh/kg). There have been significant research efforts in the area at about a decade ago, but both fundamental obstacles with regard to fully realizing the high-energy chemistry and the grim perspective in developing a useful battery pack due to the use of gas for cathode resulted in diminished interest. Near-term investments have turned to battery technology with mid-range specific energy but with reduced cost (e.g. DOE’s Battery 500 Consortium) or enhanced safety (e.g. NASA’s SABERS). 

That being said, Li-O2 electrochemistry remains to be the holy grail of battery chemistry with the highest potentially achievable specific energy among all battery platforms. In addition, since the cathodic reactant comes directly from the air atmosphere, it is an intrinsically sustainable concept. In essence, despite formidable challenges, Li-air batteries are a reluctant but inevitable choice for future green electric aviation. 

Fundamental obstacles for Li-O2 batteries include the sluggish discharge and charge reaction kinetics, the lack of cathodic capacity, and a plethora of issues plagued with Li metal anode, such as dendrite formation during large capacity or high rate charge/discharge as well as oxygen shuttling from cathodic compartment. If directly harvesting O2 from air, the moisture and CO2, as well as the low partial pressure of O2, are among critical challenges. 

NASA has previously invested in Li-air/O2 battery chemistry. For example, CAS supported the LION project, which focused on the fundamental issues with the liquid electrolyte. PI earned >4 years of IRAD support from NASA LaRC to investigate holey graphene, a novel carbon nanomaterial developed by PI at LaRC, for air cathode in Li-O2 batteries. Significant progress was made. For instance, it was demonstrated that holey graphene based air cathode may achieve areal capacities >50 mAh/cm2 (in comparison to typical Li-ion batteries’ 2 mAh/cm2). A small format pouch cell (~100 mAh) was successfully demonstrated. In related efforts, Lin also investigated Li-CO2 and Li-CO2/O2 battery chemistries for space applications. It is encouraging that the same holey graphene air cathode platform allows the partial contamination of CO2 in O2 without significantly reduced performance. 

In summary, building from both liquid-electrolyte Li-O2 (and CO2) battery and solid-state Li-S battery experiences, it is a great timing to start tackling solid-state Li-air batteries, which might be the toughest problem in aviation batteries. If successful, it could provide a sustainable, transformative, and ultimate energy storage solution for future aerospace. 

 

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

Month 3: Identify one or more solid-electrolytes suitable for Li-air/O2 batteries 

Month 6: Develop methodologies to prepare solid-state air cathode with holey graphene platform and an identified solid-electrolyte 

Month 12: Demonstrate solid-state Li-O2 battery cell performance and project the path to achieve 1000 Wh/kg 

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

It is envisioned that, with this seedling effort successfully demonstrating the feasibility and path at the battery materials level, a larger investment from ARMD could follow for a longer term effort with regard to fundamental science incorporated with both experiments and modeling, scale-up engineering, and, eventually, flight demonstration. This will be a collaborative effort across multiple Centers to take advantage of different NASA internal expertise (e.g., LaRC – battery materials, GRC – Agency lead in power and energy, ARC – battery modeling, and AFRC – flight demonstration). Involvement of academic, industrial, and other government lab partners could further strengthen the NASA-led effort. 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

The first key step of the proposed work is to identify a suitable solid electrolyte. The basic requirement is that it is non-flammable. In addition, it will need to be stable within the voltage range (~2 – 4.5V) without decomposition. It will also need to be stable against prolonged exposure to oxygen. If the subject matter expert determines that this is not feasible technically, we could pivot to various non-flammable liquid electrolytes as alternatives. The followed cathode fabrication and cell tests, as well as specific energy projection, could then be adjusted accordingly. ",,,,,,,,,

A major goal of the ARMD SIP is enabling safe, quiet, and efficient vertical lift vehicles/technologies in strategic thrust 4. In order to reduce the environmental footprint of this soon to be expansive field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles, research into novel propulsion methodologies is needed. The traditional way of designing propellers through Minimum Induced Loss (MIL) was created by Betz in 1921 and has not changed to this day [1]. There is a new propeller design, proposed in NASA TM 20210014683, which optimizes based on the minimization of torque instead of MIL [2]. We received CIF/IRAD funding last FY to perform an initial proof-of-concept on this novel propeller design, and computational results from this funding have shown that the new design provides the same amount of thrust with a 2-3% reduction in torque (and thus a 2-3% reduction in power consumption) when compared to a modern (MIL) propeller with all the same characteristics except blade twist. Another highly desired quality is a reduction in noise due to the unique loading of the propeller. The Angle of Attack (AOA) at the tip of the propeller tapers off which substantially reduces the tip loading and large shear layer intensity and thus noise generation [3]. We were awarded 2nd year CIF/IRAD funding and have 3D printed these propellers out of titanium and plan to test them in the Low-Speed Acoustic Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at Langley in Q1 FY24 in order to gather efficiency and acoustic data at the full range of advance ratios. Using TTT funding, we could extend our research by placing our novel (denoted “Prandtl”) and baseline (MIL) propellers onto an actual quadcopter, or fixed-wing subscale vehicle and compare the energy used during flight as well as the acoustic signatures between propeller designs. This could give us real-world evidence for the effective reduction in energy used in addition to acoustic noise generation which are two major improvements needed for the budding UAM field. This real-world evidence would increase the public and industry’s confidence in this new technology which would help it be implemented in real-world UAM vehicles. In the 2030-2040s timeframe, the use of VTOL vehicles in urban environments will rapidly increase and will become a large transportation industry with potentially large adverse effects to the environment in the future. The Aviation Climate Action Plan’s goal of reducing aircraft emissions by 2% each year for net carbon zero by 2050 could be realized in part by the 2% or greater reduction in energy use shown in our novel propeller design vs traditional MIL in vehicles designed for the growing field of UAM.

Describe the anticipated milestones and how your work should be evaluated upon completion. 

In order to test this novel propeller design on a real-world sub-scale vehicle, we anticipate four major milestones: 

Fabricate multiple clockwise and counterclockwise Prandtl and MIL propellers out of carbon-fiber layups for low weight, high rigidity, and high strength propeller blades 

Procure COTS quadcopter/fixed-wing vehicle and outfit with Prandtl propellers and baseline MIL propellers 

Obtain Airworthiness Review Board (ARB) and Operational Readiness Review (ORR) approvals for vehicle airworthiness statements and operational reviews for flight testing 

Flight test vehicle with novel Prandtl and baseline MIL propellers to gain data for energy used  

 

After this work is completed what do you envision as the next steps?  Where are the potential areas for transition?  What follow-on research do you anticipate?  

The team working on Prandtl Propeller (this novel propeller design) is also working on the RAVEN SWFT eVTOL sub-scale concept vehicle. One potential extension of the RAVEN SWFT vehicle that has been a goal of the team is for the vehicle to be used as an eVTOL technology testbed for efficiency and acoustic research as well as the controls research it is currently being used for. Next steps for Prandtl Propeller after testing on a COTS vehicle is testing on the experimental eVTOL RAVEN SWFT vehicle which emulates future people-carrying eVTOL vehicles in future UAM environments. Another next step is fabricating large-scale versions of Prandtl propellers and gathering experimental data to determine the scalability and feasibility of this propeller design on the scale of manned vehicles.  

 

Address the following scenario from your perspective as PI. Hypothetical situation:  Three months into this work, your team of subject matter experts determines that the initial proposed approach is not feasible technically.  You still have 9 months of funding remaining, how do you pivot?  What alternative approaches or methods would you pursue?  

Our initial proposal is to test our new Prandtl Propellers on a quadcopter or fixed-wing subscale airplane model. The current Prandtl and baseline MIL propeller was designed for an advance ratio of 0.4 which means the propellers will perform better in a forward-flight or fixed-wing airplane configuration. If we test the Prandtl and MIL propellers on a quadcopter and find that the data doesn’t represent our analysis due to the quadcopter’s propellers operating in a static (no forward velocity) configuration, then we can easily pivot to a fixed-wing aircraft. Ultimately, this issue would be solved by adding variable pitch to the propeller (a feature of the RAVEN SWFT model) which would allow for the propeller to be adjusted to optimize for static (hover) and forward-flight for different flight phases of VTOL vehicles in UAM, and this would be possible avenues for expansion in the future. Another potential roadblock would be not obtaining airworthiness approval from the ARB (unlikely). In this case, we could pivot our focus towards designing Prandtl and baseline MIL propellers for the static case which would benefit the UAM community by giving them a static (hover) as well as dynamic (forward-flight) high-efficient propeller design. In the future, we could compare the effectiveness of using the static designed propeller or dynamic designed propeller on a VTOL vehicle with its own ARB approval such as the RAVEN SWFT.  ",,,,,,,,,
Sustainability and Connected Autonomy: A New Era for Aviation (Carnegie Mellon U),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"1 Introduction
In response to the increasing threat of climate change, NASA has declared that it aims to cut carbon
emissions by half by 2050 compared to 2005, and achieve net zero emissions in 2060. Tomeet this goal,
airports, airlines, and other organizations in the aviation industry will have to reduce emissions in a major
way. Our paper focuses on how airports can be designed to support future changes in the aviation industry
with a specific emphasis on two themes: airport sustainability and autonomy. Each theme is tied to our
airport innovations and guided our final design of the airport.
To start, we modeled our initial concepts on the Denver International Airport. The new technologies
we describe center around changes in aircraft formand fuel type, gate design, urban airmobility (UAM),
storing multiple fuel types, and autonomous systems. Even though our concepts are applied to the Denver
International Airport, we believe the designs can be generalized to other airports as well.
2 2050 Aviation Landscape
In 2050, we anticipate many changes to aircraft formand energy sources. We expect sustainable aviation
fuel to be the largest proportion of the fleet followed by lesser proportions of hydrogen, ammonia, battery
powered electric aircraft. We also expect aircraft formto adapt to new on-broad fuel storage requirements
where one possible change is to a blended-wing body design. It is also likely that we will see supersonic
commercial aircraft in the future. To support these aircraft, airports will require infrastructure changes in
their gate design, aprons, and fueling and baggage loading.
Societal changes and attitudes toward flying may also have an impact on our airport design. If flying
becomes cheaper and more accessible, then total air travel is likely to increase and in turn increase the
urgency for sustainable aircraft [29]. Similarly, increases in the cost of jet fuel may make alternative fuel
sources more attractive and speed up the transition. Expedited changes to sustainable aircraft may drive
faster development of fuel storage locations, more aircraft operations vehicles, and expansive terminal
layouts. If however, sustainable aircraft technology becomes costly to develop or support, then air travel
will increase in cost and drive compromises to airport upgrades e.g. only supporting battery-electric
aircraft and not hydrogen fuel.
3 Future Aircraft Fuel Sources and Design
3.1 Sustainable Aviation Fuel
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a carbon emission friendly alternative to jet fuel. SAF is similar in
chemical composition to jet fuel, but, as opposed to requiring the extraction of new hydrocarbons, is
manufactured fromrecycled carbonmaterials [22, 67, 55]. As a result, even though SAF generates CO2
during combustion, it is not adding more net CO2 to the environment [22]. SAF is also considered a
""drop-in"" fuel that can be mixed with jet fuel and does not require storage or engine modifications
[75, 67, 56, 49]. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently allows commercial planes to fly with
up to a 50% mixture of SAF [22, 56]. Both Los Angeles andMunich airports are currently configured to
support SAFmixtures; additionally, several companies including Boeing, Rolls Royce, United Airlines, and
General Electric are conducting SAF experiments with higher percentage mixtures [22, 60, 77].
However, there are several hurdles to widespread adoption of SAF. First, the US will need to expand
available feedstocks to meet an estimated demand of 35 billion gallons on SAF in 2050 [22, 56, 70, 49].
Second, current production of SAF is limited to only a few facilities, but several thousand facilities will be
required to meet future demand [22, 70]. Third, the cost per gallon of SAF is higher than jet fuel; while SAF
prices may decrease over time, they may never be competitive with jet fuel [22].
1
Nevertheless, the Biden Administration, the FAA, and the Department of Energy have indicated that
SAF will be key to achieving decarbonization goals [22, 55, 54, 70, 13, 33]. Not only does the fuel produce
net-zero emissions, but SAF also does not require aircraft updates or significant airport infrastructure
changes. As a result, we assume SAF production will increase and fuel a large proportion of the fleet in
2050.
3.2 Hydrogen Fuel
Hydrogen fuel, used in either combustion or as an electricity generating fuel cell, does not create CO2
emissions and can be considered a zero-carbon energy source if generated with renewable sources
[2, 4, 13]. Hydrogen also contains more energy per kilogram than jet fuel. On the other hand, hydrogen is
much less volume dense, up to a factor of 3000:1 when compared with jet fuel at standard temperature
and pressure [2]. Pressurizing and cryogenic-cooling hydrogen can reduce volumetric density to a 4:1
ratio, which is more suitable for aviation [2, 13]. Nevertheless, aircraft design changes, such as a new
blended wing-body design, are likely needed to accommodate large sophisticated hydrogen storage tanks
[2, 13, 33, 46, 40]. Airbus, for example, is developing several hydrogen powered aircraft in their “ZEROe”
program scheduled to debut in 2035 [2, 5]. ZeroAvia is also developing smaller and shorter range hydrogen
fuel cell aircraft with a goal of commercial flights before 2030 [33, 78].
Three additional challenges to hydrogen fuel include establishing the required logistics of transporting,
storing and distributing hydrogen at the airport [13, 66], reducing hydrogen generation costs [33], and
public acceptance. While early hydrogen adoption at airports can be supplied with truck deliveries,
pipelines will provide more reliable and safe fuel transportation for the long-term [46]. Safe storage of
hydrogen is more complicated due to pressurization and cooling requirements and will likely require new
infrastructure [65]. For distribution, airport trucks may be the best option over expensive costs to upgrade
jet fuel hydrant systems [46]. Hydrogen is also currently several times more expensive than jet fuel and, to
have a zero-CO2 lifecycle (""green hydrogen""), will require generation through electrolysis, which is costly
and not yet implemented at scale [33, 46]. Finally, the introduction of a new fuel may require long-term
engagement with the public to address concerns and reduce hurdles with public acceptance.
The pace of hydrogen aircraft development is uncertain. Some believe there will be faster rate
of adoption of hydrogen aircraft [46], but we are more conservative due to the scope of the required
technology innovations, likely aircraft design changes, and the subsequent FAA certification process
[13, 33]. As a result, we believe hydrogen aircraft may be an emerging fuel source in 2050, but is unlikely
to be a significant portion of the fleet.
3.3 Ammonia Fuel
Ammonia is another promising fuel source for aviation. Recent developments by Reaction Engines
use heat to separate ammonia into an ammonia-hydrogen mixture which can be used for zero-carbon
emission combustion in a jet engine [19]. Ammonia is often viewed as an alternative to hydrogen fuel due
to its higher density per volume, see Figure 2, and higher boiling point [14, 24, 20]. A higher volumetric
density may make it possible to retrofit current aircraft designs [19]. A higher boiling point for liquid
ammonia also aids in simplifying fuel storage [14, 38, 20]. Additionally, ammonia production is already
well established with 180 million tons produced annually [57, 23, 38, 20].
One disadvantage to ammonia fuel are possible environmental impacts. While ammonia promises
zero carbon emissions, it may produce other air pollutants, such as nitrous oxide (NOx) [19, 14]. NOx
can have negative environmental impacts and is believed to cause 16,000 premature deaths each year
[14, 59]. Even though ammoniamay only produce half as much NOx as jet fuel, hydrogen fuel would not
produce any NOx emissions [24]. As a result, given the balance of benefits with environmental challenges
2
of ammonia fuel and the early stage of technology development, we believe ammonia will be adopted in
similarmanner to hydrogen fuel.
3.4 Electric Aircraft
New advancements in battery technology are expanding to electric aviation. Companies such as Lilium,
Kittyhawk, Beta, Archer and Joby Aviation are developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOLs)
aircraft to serve as short range air taxis [44, 41, 15, 10, 39] and Airbus, Rolls Royce, and Eviation are
researching fixed wing electric platforms [3, 62, 27, 42]. Even though electric aircraft produce zeroemissions,
batteries have a low energy density relative to traditional fuels sources, see Figure 2 [72]. This
leads to limited range and payload for future electric aircraft. Markets for electric aircraft still exist however,
both in boosting urban mobility and serving short regional flights. Cape Air, for example, operates short
range flights in New England and is purchasing Eviation’s “Alice” all-electric aircraft for use in their routes
[73, 35, 9]. Harbour Air in the Pacific Northwest serves a similar set of short range customers with their
battery electric converted seaplanes [25, 32].
One challenge to electric aircraft is developing the required battery recharging infrastructure. Most
airports are located near a power grid which can directly supply electricity; however, some airports in
more remote locations likely need a local energy source, such as a system of solar panels [7]. Airports
near a power grid may still require infrastructure upgrades, however, due to increased peak and total
power demand from electric aircraft batteries [76, 43, 37]. Applying a battery-swap paradigm can reduce
instantaneous energy demand and improve aircraft turn-around time, but will require a battery storage
and charging location [76, 31]. Finally, standardization of charging infrastructure and installation at all
airports, similar to passenger boarding bridges, is important for electric aircraft adoption [76].
In summary, even though the electricity grid is accessible at most airports, given the low energy density
of near future battery technology, electric aircraft will be part of the near-termdecarbonization solution
but may only serve short distance flights.
3.5 Hybrid Electric Aircraft
We define hybrid electric aircraft as aircraft that have both batteries and combustible fuel and can implement
a variety of different propulsion designs [61]. Specifically, we are interested in three designs: electric
propulsion powered by batteries which can be recharged during flight with a fuel powered generator [18],
electric propulsion powered by a gas turbine which can be augmented by batteries during periods of high
power demand (e.g. during take-off) [63], and a mix of both electric and fuel propulsion [63]. Several
companies are exploring hybrid electric aircraft including Electra, Embraer, Ampaire, Honeywell, Faradair
and Rolls Royce [18, 17, 8, 36, 63, 61]. Early development trajectories indicate that hybrid electric aircraft
will fill shorter range regional markets with passenger quantities similar to all electric aircraft [18, 17, 61].
Given the similarities in markets, technologies required and the active prototyping of hybrid electric
aircraft today, we believe that hybrid electric aircraft will be adopted on a similar timeframe and in similar
proportions to all-electric aircraft [18].
3.6 Aircraft Form
This section will discuss our anticipated aircraft design changes through the year 2050. We primarily
considered modifications to traditional commercial airplanes and to Urban AirMobility (UAM) vehicles.
Additionally, the form of new aircraft will greatly depend on a newer approach to air travel. We expect
commercial airplanes in particular to take an approach made up of high frequency, short distance flights.
The planes will likely be more compact and, as a result, more aerodynamic. The changes to formwill likely
be supplemented with stronger,more sustainablematerials [50].
3
The airplane form changes that have the most potential for the 2050 landscape are blended-wing
body (BWB) and the strut-braced wing (SBW) designs. The SBWdesign of aircraft does not have many
features that lend it to compatibility with the other feasible technologies we have identified, so we will
be focusing on the BWB design as our primary advancement in aircraft form. The BWB design is simply
a single connected wing with a payload area for passengers and/or cargo in the middle. The degree of
blending between the wings and body can be manipulated to maximize efficiency and reduce noise
pollution, supporting our overall goal. New designs rely on optimizing aerodynamics to reduce single-trip
fueling frequency, which enables both long range flying and short range, high frequency flying [51]. The
German Aerospace Center (DLR) is further researching the potential of a larger BWB design for passengers
with an expected 2040 completion. These larger BWB designs rely primarily on hybrid fueling to support
sustainability efforts and long range flying [29]. These designs can also be used for long range cargo
transport for areas that cannot be reached by smaller UAMs. NASA and Boeing have already begun
working on BWB concepts for commercial usage with the aforementioned qualities. Since BWB aircraft
are already in use for military purposes, this may allow commercial airlines to pursue an amend-type
certification from the FAA (3-5 years) versus an air-worthiness certification (5-9 years) [28].
In addition to the larger capacity provided by BWB aircraft, supersonic commercial airplanes may also
be available. This design will benefit airport operations because passengermovement will flow quicker
and the concept of short range, high frequency flying can be realized. However, supersonic aircraft need
to overcome their structural and noise issues before mass adoption. On this front, LockheedMartin’s X-59
QueSST is a test aircraft being developed to resolve different issues with supersonic aircraft before it can
be mass produced for commercial purposes [52].
4 Airport Innovations
4.1 Design Themes
Our proposed innovations to airport design can be summarized by two themes: sustainability and
connected autonomy. Sustainability focuses on two initiatives: first, supporting new aircraft through
advanced terminal layouts and gate design, vertical landing ports, and centralized fuel storage; second,
allowing for expansion of airport technologies and capacity to support increasing aviation demand. Our
second theme, connected autonomy, is central to airport operations. We envision autonomous vehicles
completing task across the airport such as moving baggage, food, fuel, passengers, etc. Each autonomous
vehicle will be connected to a larger network to ensure safe movement and efficient operations. Both of
our themes encompass how the airport of the future will adapt to new aircraft designs and increasing
demand for air travel.
Each of the design innovations supporting our themes is discussed in detail in the following sections
with a summary including estimated technology readiness levels (TRLs) provided in Table 1. Our TRL
estimates are derived fromNASA definitions as described in the Appendix, Figure 3.
4.1.1 Remote Pier Terminal Layout
After researching the differentmodels for airport tarmac and terminal configurations, we believe that the
remote pier (also called concourse) design would be the ideal model for airports of the future. The remote
pier design maximizes apron use, as compared to pier and satellite designs, with arriving planes spending
less time on the ground taxiing, waiting to refuel, and moving between gates. The system has also proved
to be very efficient for handling passengers, but the distances between the terminal and the concourse
necessitate the use of a sophisticated people-mover system [11].
4
Table 1: A summary of our design themes and innovations with an assessment of present day Technology Readiness
Levels and Pros and Cons. (1. reference [71])
The remote pier design is also strategic as it can incorporate future updates to airport developments
and aircraft changes. For example, hydrogen-powered aircraft may be slightly longer than traditional
gate parking spaces [46] and BWB designs may be wider; a remote pier design will be readily adaptable to
these changes. The remote piers can also be extended horizontally to add more gates for larger volumes
of flights and passengers.
In the future, we will likely have an updated version of a shuttle running between the concourses,
either under or above ground. This system will have to be highly efficient to get passengers to the farthest
concourse in a reasonable amount of time. Since the concourses can also be very long, there will need to
be a people-moving system within the airport as well.
4.1.2 Gate Design
When considering gate design, aircraft design will dictate the requirements. According to NASA’s studies
on blended wing-body aircraft, these planes can operate out of existing airport terminals [51]. These
planes have a wingspan slightly larger than a Boeing 747, and cargo and passengers can utilize entrances
at the front and rear of the aircraft. Because of the larger wingspan, it may be useful to have gates farther
apart, or even designate two gates to a flight in order to facilitate more efficient boarding of the plane since
there will be a much larger capacity for passengers available. There are already some flights that have
multiple jet bridges to different entrances; this systemis typically used to board first class and business
class from separate entrances. Thismodel can be used with blended wing-body aircraft as well.
4.1.3 Urban AirMobility Landing Port
Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is a burgeoning mode of transportation for moving passengers over short
distances, similar to a taxi and airports are a likely destination to support UAM infrastructure. To support
UAM traffic, we envision a large landing area near the airport where passengers can disembark and
proceed to the terminal. In terms of airport integration, the Denver International Airport’s remote pier
layout and large airport footprint can accommodate such a design with ease. There is space for the
landing port and passenger transport to be located on the airport in a safe and operable location without
interfering with other airport activities. The landing area would also require significant electrification
infrastructure to meet UAM aircraft recharge requirements before departing. Autonomy plays a large
role in the landing port area for the UAMs because many of the operations, like passenger transport and
5
maintenance, do not have to be handled by human operators. Aside from passenger movement, UAMs
can be used to handle small scale logistics transportation. Any shipments can be efficiently transported
across the city without relying on road vehicles and traffic.
4.1.4 Centralized Energy Hub
Each of the possible future energy sources has different storage requirements. Our proposed innovation is
to expand current jet fuel storage areas into a centralized, multi-fuel energy hub. In this configuration,
jet fuel containers will remain in place and be used to store Sustainable Aircraft Fuel mixtures [56, 49].
Hydrogen will require new storage infrastructure to meet pressurization, cooling and safety requirements
[65] and likely additional space due to its lower volumetric density [6]. Similar to hydrogen, ammonia is
likely to be stored in a liquid state with specific requirements driving new infrastructure [38, 20, 26, 16].
The final component to the energy hub will be a battery recharge and swap center which will assist in
faster aircraft turn around time by replacing aircraft batteries at the gate versus recharging [76, 31]. The
depleted batteries can then be recharged at the battery storage facility for a future aircraft. Furthermore,
this energy hub can be tied into an airport power generation facility that can be fueled by on-site solar
power or hydrogen fuel and can help supplement contributions from the grid. In summary, new fuel types
will require new infrastructure with associated costs; while most technologies are not new, they have yet
to be implemented in a combined airport facility.
4.1.5 Connected Autonomy
We anticipate that the airport of the future will rely heavily on connected autonomous vehicles, which will
conduct aircraft operations and routine tasks safely and efficiently. Several types of airport operations
vehicles have autonomous prototypes in development including baggage trucks [12], snow plows [48, 47,
64], bird mitigation vehicles [68, 21] and even aircraftmaintenance and preflight inspections [1, 30, 45].
To enable safe coordination, each autonomous vehicle will broadcast its position and activities to nearby
vehicles and larger planning systems. Knowledge of the surrounding environment will prevent vehicle
incidents and may also allow for more efficient vehicle movements instead of requiring a defined set
of vehicle paths. Autonomous systems may also enable rapid decision making which may prove to be
essential for supporting increased aviation demand.
Essential to a connected environment are fortified cybersecurity networks. The risks associated
with adversary intrusion into autonomous airport vehicles could be catastrophic and, as a result, the
airport network will require additional protection measures fromexploits, viruses, and other ransomware.
Cybersecurity protectionmeasures may not always be a perfect solution and therefore a human presence
will likely still be required in airport operations to respond in the event of an attack. This is essential for
the safety of passengers and operators throughout the airport.
4.1.6 Standardized and Autonomous Logistics Containers
A specific subset of the connected autonomy innovation is the incorporation of standardized containers for
baggage, packages, batteries, food, fuel etc. We envision that these containers will be battery or hydrogen
powered and autonomous, similar to the design from Aurrigo [12] or Plug Power [34]. Standardization
of the containers will allow for an efficient sequencing of payloads, e.g. bring food to an aircraft arrival,
transport baggage back to the terminal, then transport new baggage from the terminal to another flight
etc. These containers could also have their own automated entrances and exits to the airport terminal
that are close to the gates so that there isminimal above-ground disruption where the planes are taxiing.
In the future, there may also be opportunities to airlift the logistics containers to decrease transit
duration, for example bringing fuel or batteries from a distant storage location. The Defense Advanced
6
Research Projects Agency, LockheedMartin, and Piasecki Aircraft were developing Aerial Reconfigurable
Embedded System (ARES) vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial system to fill this function;
however, the program was recently cancelled due to cost overruns and technical challenges [58, 74].
Nevertheless, this mode of transportationmay be worth exploring in the future as technologymatures.
4.2 Technology Development Timeline
The pace of implementation for each of our innovations is varied and dependent on both aircraft and
infrastructure developments. Figure 1 summarizes our technology development timeline.
Figure 1: A technology development timeline for our airport design concepts. The pace of innovation is dependent
on changes to aircraft and infrastructure.
5 Conclusions
Tomeet the 2050 sustainability goals set by organizations like NASA, airports will have to adopt similar
themes of sustainability and autonomy. Our themes encompass a set of innovations including a new
terminal layout and gate designs, an Urban Air Mobility landing port, a centralized energy storage,
and a network of connected autonomous vehicles. Each of these design concepts are at a sufficient
technology readiness level that they could be developed and available by 2050. The innovations also
provide necessary improvements for new aircraft and are flexible in implementation and expansion.
Although our innovations were initially based on applications to Denver International Airport, many of
our recommendations can be applied to other airports. As a result, our concepts can be broadly applied
tomeet 2050 decarbonization goals",,,,,,,,,

The timeliness and convenience of air transportation has led to billions of passengers utilizing air travel each year. Future advancements in aircraft technology will only increase industry appeal, causing a rise in air traffic and passenger rate. Although beneficial for airlines, this is a cause for environmental concern, as the aviation industry currently emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) between heavy flight traffic, nonrenewable fuel sources, and airport operations themselves. To prevent detrimental and irreversible environmental effects, changes must be implemented within the industry, including within airport operations.
Major airline companies and aviation contributors are working on plans for greener flight within aircraft design and fuel consumption, working toward the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Alterations of these aircraft are projected to greatly decrease harmful emissions and promote flight efficiency. The success and viability of these developments is largely reliant on airports’ ability to accommodate them with necessary infrastructure. To successfully fly with fuel-efficient engines, for example, commercial airlines first require access to adequate refueling facilities and timely turnaround processes that will ensure company profitability. If future aircraft changes do come to fruition, appropriate space and facilities must be ready to accommodate them.
Project ECOAir proposes a design that suits the estimated changes in aircraft while altering current ground processes. The concept aims to promote airport convenience and efficiency, aircraft accommodation, and sustainability. Accounting for the vast predicted increase in passenger rate by 2050, the bridged gate-pod design will disperse passenger activity to mitigate gate congestion and boarding complications. Subsequent open ground space will allow aircraft to taxi between gates and runways with ease, reducing ground traffic. The current complex and costly baggage transportation process will be optimized and transitioned underground, minimizing complications for both airlines and passengers. Several fuel options will be made available, and waste from processes such as deicing will be conserved. Ground support equipment will be mostly autonomous to improve safety and decrease turnaround time. Regarding the airport facility itself, clean energy and sustainable building materials will be utilized to decrease direct emissions.
By incorporating environmentally friendly technologies and reliable infrastructure, Project ECOAir’s airport will sustain efficiency in air travel to promote a brighter future of aviation.
Preliminary Research and Assessment
2050 Commercial Aviation Outlook
To perform an analysis of the expected aviation outlook in 2050, the current state of the industry must be accounted for. This includes an assessment of commercial aviation consumers, vehicle structure, energy sources, and current environmental status.
Air Transportation Rate. Passenger traffic rate experienced a steady growth for decades until 2020, when the Coronavirus pandemic led to a substantial decrease in commercial air transportation. In 2019, the global airline industry served 4.558 billion passengers [19], declining to 1.8 billion during the pandemic [27]. Boeing predicts a near full recovery by 2024 [31], and by 2050, it is estimated that the global air industry will haul 16 billion passengers and 400 tons of cargo [56]. The projected increase in global population from 7.7 billion to 9.7 billion people [29] will lead to an inevitable increase in air transportation. This will require nearly double the number of today’s operational aircraft, estimating 50,000 functional planes worldwide in 2050 [54].
Aircraft Shapes and Designs. Today, most commercial planes consist of a long, slender fuselage, a vertical and horizontal stabilizer within the empennage, and capacities of 100-200 passengers [20]. Within this layout, aircraft such as the Boeing 737 family and Airbus 320 have been ruling the industry for decades. On average, it takes 15 years for major aircraft companies to begin mass production and roll out of new plane designs. Furthermore, the considerable financial component involved in major alterations disincentivizes innovation within already working components. Therefore, it is expected that the primary aircraft flown commercially in 2050 will consist of similar physical layouts to current models, with some size variations and material changes.

PROJECT ECOAIR
As one of the primary contributors to commercial aviation, Boeing will likely implement aircraft improvements over the next 30 years. Recent development has been seen on the 787-Dreamliner, making it one of the top commercial aircraft in use in terms of efficiency and sustainability. Improvements have shown a 30% decrease in its CO2 emissions and a 60% decrease in its noise footprint compared to previous models [3]. The strong carbon fiber structure and 30% fuel reduction from hybrid laminar flow control [46] predict the 787 as a leading force in coming years. Developments have also been made on the Boeing ecoDemonstrator (Figure 1), which is predicted to serve a significant number of passengers by 2050. After testing in 2021, Boeing reported that the hybrid fueled aircraft is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by 75% throughout its lifecycle, powered by sustainable fuel and incorporating recycled materials like carbon-composite fiber. This model is currently undergoing testing between NASA and Boeing to research the effects of sustainable fuel use in its engines [10].
Aside from Boeing, Airbus has announced promising expectations for 2050 with their ZEROe aircraft (Figure 2). The ZEROe series consists of three liquid hydrogen powered design concepts, including the Turbofan, Turboprop, and Blended-Wing Body [6]. These aircraft include a hybrid-electric propulsion system, using fuel cells to complement the gas turbine [7]. By 2035, this aircraft series will be able to carry ranges of 100-200 passengers over 1,000 to 2,000NM distances, progressing to commercial use in the next 30 years.
Green technologies are also being developed for use in general aviation that will have strong capabilities by 2050. Small aerospace companies are creating sustainable flying methods involving all-electric models that produce little noise and zero carbon emissions. The Pipistrel Group has revolutionized pilot training with the Electro plane models (Figure 3), which require short takeoff and landing distances and significantly decrease training costs by 70% [44]. Lilium is developing the first general aviation vertical take-off and landing jet; an all-electric plane with a 6-passenger capacity that will be launched into commercial operations by 2024 [35]. Dozens of additional aerospace companies are developing electric solutions to decrease carbon emissions and provide private pilots with better flying experiences.
Overall, research shows that the most prominent large passenger flights will occur with Boeing 767, 777, and 787s, while handfuls of 737’s and 747’s will still be in operation. The ecoDemonstrator and Dreamliner models will provide large contributions to efficient long-duration travel. Airbus’s main contributions will continue to be the 320-350 models, with an emphasis on the functional operational development of the ZEROe series. It is probable that the industry will see several successful passenger flights with the ZEROe planes, as well as fully electric powered general aviation aircraft.
Renewable Fuels and Energy Sources. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global aviation industry contributed 2.1% of the world’s CO2 emissions, producing 915 million tons of CO2 in 2019 [5]. Representatives of air transportation have recently declared the urgent goal to reduce this number to net zero emissions within the next 30 years. The largest current contributor to aviation emissions is aircraft fuel, and therefore drastic alterations to the fuel types used must occur.
The most promising fuel outlook for 2050 is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made of resources such as feedstocks and waste oils [12]. By implementing SAF, the industry aims for an 80% CO2 emission reduction compared to conventional kerosene [50]. A major benefit of SAF is the simplicity of implementation, as combustion does not require installing a new propulsion system within current aircraft. It is currently being integrated into traditional aircraft fuel, with some airlines incorporating SAF at ratios of 10-15% [33]. To reach a complete use of SAF in 2050, up to 445 million tons will be needed annually at that time [3]. The future of this fuel type looks promising according to Boeing, who recently committed to a supply agreement of 2 million gallons of SAF, with plans for 100% SAF implementation by 2030 [40]. Due to manufacturing companies’
Figure 1: Boeing ecoDemonstrator [11]
Figure 2: Pipistrel electric aircraft fleet [45]
Figure 3: Airbus ZEROe series [8]
3
PROJECT ECOAIR
increased interest in sustainable fuel, there is an expected decrease in price in the near future. Therefore, it is assumed for this report that the use of SAF will be widely available in 2050.
Alternatively, Airbus is confident in plans for the ZEROe aircraft series, which will be primarily powered by liquid hydrogen. Although not currently developed to the point of SAF, testing of 𝐻2 is currently underway to fulfill the requirements for incorporation into industry by 2035. In the year 2050, 𝐻2 will be a sustainable method of propulsion for new Airbus models and will produce zero carbon emissions [6].
Within general aviation, fully electric propulsion systems will likely be integrated by 2050. Although they will not be optimized for large scale commercial aviation, it is projected that most functional private planes will be made with electric capabilities. This system will cut CO2 emissions and decrease the cost of private flying drastically. In sum, it is likely that SAF, liquid hydrogen, and minor electric power will make up most aircraft propulsion techniques used in 2050. As such, it is crucial that these options be readily available to various airlines within future airport designs.
Landscape. Future rising sea levels predict that multiple U.S. airports will be submerged by the year 2150. When designing an airport for 2050, it is important to consider continual changes in landscape factors past this timeline to analyze the type of renovations and maintenance this design will require. There is an estimated 5m sea level rise by 2150; problematic for several airports including JFK, MIA, and SFO [14]. As these major U.S. airports become inoperable due to environmental factors, any new airport design should be placed in a location where sea level rises do not have a direct impact.
ECOAir Design Rationale
Location. The proposed location of this airport is Fairfax County, Virginia. The nearby existing airport, Dulles International Airport (IAD), is considered the primary airport for Virginia and Washington D.C., with 103 nonstop domestic and 52 international destinations [1]. In 2019, IAD served 24.06 million passengers, making it one of the busiest and largest airports in the U.S. [39]. Despite its heavy traffic rate, IAD has few plans to become sustainable and eco-friendly. According to U.S. News, IAD produced 3.97 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, with a carbon intensity of 95 [37]. These emissions could decrease with the implementation of a new, nearby design.
Fairfax County was chosen due to its proximity to major cities, projected population increase, elevation, and potential for carbon emission decrease. At an elevation of 312 feet [23], this location provides optimal atmospheric conditions for takeoff and landing and is located outside of the range of problematic sea level increase. The county population is projected to grow by nearly 200,000, reaching 1,308,224 by 2040 [57], deeming it a suitable location for industry and employment opportunities. The average annual temperature is predicted to rise from 56.5˚F currently to 60.7˚F in 2050, providing optimal conditions for functional renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and solar panels [41]. This airport, in replacement of Dulles, will become a central destination for the Northeastern United States. The current Dulles airport will primarily function as a cargo and non-passenger transportation hub. Consequently, passenger emissions will be largely reduced, while still utilizing the space occupied by Dulles’ current facility.
Physical Airport Structure. The new airport will centralize all passenger activities within the main building. There will be an underground facility that hosts all preflight activities prior to leading passengers up escalators to the main floor, where they will begin the boarding procedure. Passengers will be directed through one of the four bridges that span across the taxiways, each leading to several gate pods. These pods separate what would be considered a main terminal into smaller sections to decrease passenger congestion and provide convenient gate access. Extending above each terminal is a rounded bridge that allows easy transport between gates for passengers with connecting flights. This simplification allows these
Figure 4: ECOAir airport concept
4
PROJECT ECOAIR
passengers to bypass the main building and incoming bridge traffic during layovers. Planes can easily arrive and depart from gates more independently from surrounding aircraft and will have plenty of space to move between pods to reach the runways. The back wing-like walls provide storage for ground operation equipment on one side and small electric charging stations on the other. See Figure 4 for the final design.
Infrastructure. The airport building infrastructure is sustainable, made from materials such as mass timber and reused steel. Mass timber is fire-resistant and strong, weighing 1/5 that of a concrete alternative and demonstrating a high strength-to-weight ratio [53]. Construction is cost efficient, as mass timber buildings are roughly 25% faster to construct than concrete buildings and require 90% less construction traffic. Replacing steel with mass timber reduces building carbon emissions by roughly 20%. The use of mass timber can also sequester CO2, ultimately inverting emissions [53]. Additionally, the airport incorporates electrochromic glass windows as a means of energy conservation. As the U.S. Department of Energy reports, conventional windows experience energy loss accounting for 30% of heating and cooling energy. Using electrochromic “smart” glass that adapts to external conditions will minimize energy use by reducing heat energy in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, as well as electrical lighting year-round [48]. Electrochromic windows have been evaluated to provide significant heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting savings, specifically in commercial buildings. They are especially efficient when windows are unobstructed by neighboring buildings, making it a beneficial component of this airport that is surrounded by flat land. Finally, the exterior roofing and general exterior of the airport will be colored white. A light exterior will reduce greenhouse effects by a small margin and will keep the airport cooler in the summers, reducing energy consumption via the HVAC system [43].
Apron and Taxiways. The ground space will be comprised of graphene-enhanced materials using the recently developed Gipave technology: a polymeric asphalt super modifier made of nanotechnology and recycled plastic [30]. Not only is this material proven to resist long term deformation on busy runways, but it will produce 70% less CO2 emissions compared to standard asphalt [58]. Results from testing the low-maintenance, environmentally friendly material project it to be a cost effective, sensible option for a 2050 airport.
Ground Operations. The majority of ground support equipment, including crew transport and taxiing devices, will be fully electric and mostly autonomous. These devices will be stored in the back wings of the facility with access to several charging stations powered by solar panels.
To conserve fuel, Taxibots will assist pilots in gate pushback and guide the plane across the apron (Figure 5) [51]. A Taxibot is a semi-autonomous device controllable by the pilot, capable of towing large class aircraft. CO2 emissions and noise levels will be significantly reduced because of its use, as aircraft engines will not have to be powered on upon initial departure. No aircraft modifications will be required for this device to be used, and 85% of the normal taxiing fuel consumption will be cut compared to current gate pushback processes [28]. Fuel can be conserved so that the pilot must only power on the engines directly before takeoff, at which point the Taxibot will continue directing the plane to the runway, streamlining traffic on the apron. The Taxibot and other autonomous devices will increase the safety of ground operations. Incorporating artificial intelligence will decrease ground accidents caused by human error, while still allowing options for pilots to take full control of the plane’s path if necessary.
Deicing. Today, aircraft deicing procedures result in the excess drainage of harmful chemicals into local water supplies. Solutions to this issue have been attempted by collecting the runoff water, yet this does not completely negate the thousands of gallons of wasteful fluid currently used in a single process.
To combat the issue of wasted deicing fluid, two alternative methods will be implemented at this airport. First, an open hangar will be built with infrared lighting to mostly replace use of fluid. This hangar will reduce glycol use by as much as 90% and will complete the deicing process in 75% less time than current methods. As a second option to infrared, controlled atmosphere separation technology (CAST) will be available, should standard glycol mixtures be needed in severe weather conditions. CAST will distill the mixture of deicing fluid and water
Figure 5: Taxibot in use [51]
5
PROJECT ECOAIR
collected on the ground to separate the fluid from runoff water. With CAST, up to 57% of all the deicing fluid used on aircraft can be treated for further re-use or resale [16]. By recovering the deicing fluid using this process, airports currently can save nearly $3.50 per gallon recycled. This economic benefit will allow CAST to maintain a profit over time and will be a greener alternative to allowing deicing fluid to drain into the Fairfax County water supplies. Overall, pairing infrared technology with as-needed fluid separation procedures will drastically decrease wasted material, and infrared heating will especially improve turnaround time between flights.
Baggage. Baggage systems in current airports include a variety of conveyor belts and scanners, tracking luggage from main baggage check to the aircraft. It requires substantial labor to move bags off the belts, onto trucks, and into the plane. A large portion of traffic on the ground space is a result of time-consuming luggage loading. To mitigate mistakes and time delays, this system will be optimized and redesigned. Bags will be transported via conveyor belts from baggage check to an underground sorting location, centralized underneath the main structure of the airport. Here, bags will be autonomously sorted into grouped luggage pod units using pre-existing scanning technology and machine learning. These pods will move on radial conveyor belts directly up to the gate to which they will be captured and loaded into the aircraft.
Fuel. Fuel sources will be available for refueling at gates through an underground piping system. SAF and liquid hydrogen fuel lines will be separated, each leading to different gates. Refueling will continue to take place simultaneously with passenger turnover. Automated fuel trucks will be available as a secondhand fueling option, should there be maintenance occurring on the underground piping system. A liquid hydrogen hub, primarily used by ZEROe planes, will be placed on the airport grounds, using electrolysis to provide fuel to the fuel lines.
Sustainable Energy. Project ECOAir has incorporated several forms of sustainable energy sources projected to be easily accessible 30 years from now: the main features being solar panels and wind turbines. Considering the expected upcoming surge in use of solar energy, solar panels are a lucrative option to power airport components. This is due to their low cost and the anticipated high demand for rechargeable hybrid aircraft. Panels will be located on the roof of the main building as well as edges of the airspace. Strategically placed mirrors will redirect deflected light to surrounding panels, increasing each panel’s efficiency, while adhering to FAA regulations regarding glare [32]. Sun tracking technology will also be used to align the panels so that maximum efficiency can be achieved throughout each day. Most of the solar power output will contribute to the electric charging stations in place for both aircraft and ground support equipment.
Quiet Revolution vertical axis wind turbines (Figure 7) will be placed in pairs along the edges of the airport green space, each pair spanning 9.3m to prevent wind interference. Variations of 6m tall masts support the turbines, using a hydraulic system to position the turbine horizontally for maintenance. Energy conversion results from a 3.13m diameter of rotation, requiring significantly less space than traditional wind turbines [45]. These turbines will be used for their sustainable, carbon-fiber composition and impact on noise reduction. They will operate under 20m/s wind speeds, making them a useful option for Fairfax, County, as the highest expected wind speed ranges from 4-10m/s [13]. These devices are predicted to remain operational for the airport past the year 2080, prior to needing replacement.
Geothermal technology will be utilized in the form of an underground piping system, taking advantage of the natural difference between subsurface soil temperatures and above-ground air. The main building will be heated through a series of buried pipes circulating fluid. A heat exchanger will then transfer heat into the building’s existing air handling, distribution, and ventilation systems. Fluid will be recirculated back into the ground and heated again. For cooling, the geothermal heat pump will use the ground as its heat sink, releasing heat through the pipeline loop configuration [21]. This geothermal method is especially

efficient because it is not dependent on consistent temperatures and weather conditions. This technology will reduce the airport greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to standard heating processes. It will also reduce water consumption, eliminating the costliest components of the airport’s HVAC system [53].
Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)
Integral components of this proposal involve technology that has mainly been successfully tested, while minor additions require further improvement to be put into use. Assessing TRLs can provide an estimate of the improvements necessary to integrate this airport design in the coming years. See Table 1 and 2 below for a breakdown of these assessments [55].

PROJECT ECOAIR
Implementation Timeline
Below is a timeline representing major technology milestones relating to the airport technology. These advancements are necessary for the complete success of this 2050’s design concept.
Conclusion
ECOAir’s design concept features will greatly increase airport efficiency and contribute to the industry-wide goal of reaching net-zero emissions. Passenger convenience is achieved through streamlined paths to terminals, while ground operation efficiency is optimized through use of automated devices and underground baggage transportation. This airport concept can accommodate the predicted variability in aircraft, offering a variety of fuel options and adequate ground space. Finally, sustainability will be achieved through use of eco-friendly runway materials, renewable energy, and waste conservation. Future developments within this proposal will focus mainly on the baggage system and deicing process. Regarding baggage, current AI developments suggest that passengers could be offered additional options regarding their luggage claim, such as allowing the airport to deliver luggage within a defined radius. Additionally, innovative uses for the conserved deicing fluid should be explored, such as storing the leftover glycol from CAST for deicing wind turbines in cold weather. Further developing these unique elements will elevate the success and capability of the facility.
In the next 30 years, air travel will undergo exciting developments to curate a more sustainable industry. While monitoring innovation of commercial aircraft, engineers must think creatively to construct facilities that will adapt to the anticipated changes, ensuring adequate aircraft resources and positive passenger experience. The TRL levels listed indicate that this airport concept is implementable, as much of the technology is available. Therefore, airports do currently have the potential to transition to greener flight. However, the cost and construction implications of tearing down and remodeling an existing airport present an array of limitations. It is for this reason that this project proposes an entirely new design with alternative plans for existing locations.
Aviation in its past, present, and future states is centered around innovation. From the first successful flights of early aircraft models to now, where thousands of commercial aircraft operate each day, the industry has made significant advancements that have gained substantial societal interest. Looking toward the future, engineering initiatives such as Project ECOAir are pushing the boundaries of conventional air transportation, promoting monumental strides toward greener flights and bluer skies.",,,,,,,,,
Carbon Negative: A Modular Approach to Advancing Green Airport Infrastructure (U Penn),"UI Blue Skies Competition 2022 - ""Airports of Tomorrow""",,"1. Overview:
The aviation industry has undergone several developments from its inception in 1903 to its
transformation in security measures in the post-9/11 world. In the next 30 years, especially as regular
travel operations resume post-pandemic, our research team anticipates a significant increase in the scope
of the aviation sector and a sizable increase in the number of passengers relying on commercial aviation.
As consumer and industry demands change, so will airport and airline offerings, which will revolutionize
the way we view the critical environmental consequences of this industry.
Following the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the aviation industry
has recently made major advances towards becoming more sustainable and efficient. From a commercial
manufacturer point of view, this is evidenced by the rise of ultra-efficient long haul aircraft such as the
787 and A350, which offer 25-30% less fuel burn and CO2 emission per seat over earlier widebody
airplanes1. These commercial and technological advancements have been accompanied by infrastructural
efforts to make airports more environmentally and economically friendly, such as solar panel installations
and green roofs. These advances have not only improved sustainability for airports and airline carriers,
but they have also helped expand routes and connect developing countries, which have limited funding
for airports, to global air transport networks. As a result, technological advancements that lead to
increased airline sustainability are also heavily economically incentivized both for governments and
commercial airline carriers.
Many experts and previous research have come to an agreement that airports’ carbon footprints
have the biggest impact on sustainability within the aviation sector.2 Aviation accounts for an estimated
2.5% of global carbon emissions3. More specifically, the ten largest airports worldwide generate an
estimated 127 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually4. In fact, According to E Terrenoire et. al,
carbon dioxide alone is expected to contribute to 36-51% of climate change caused by aviation in the
short-term, and to have an even greater effect in the long term due to the gasses' long residence time in the
atmosphere.5
As of today, airports and international organizations have set goals to achieve carbon neutrality by
2050, including 242 airports in the United States6. However, as of 2021, only four airports have met this
objective, including Austin-Bergstrom International airport7. We believe that in the next 30 years, it will
become necessary for all 242 airports to collectively produce and implement novel technologies in order
to become carbon neutral.
In this report, we will assess various carbon mitigating technologies, including the rise of electric
aircraft, the rise of electric support vehicles, and the use of advanced airport infrastructure, which will all
collectively help airports work towards carbon neutrality objectives by 2050. For each of these

technologies, we will showcase its implementation, assess its impact on creating more sustainable
airports, and address its feasibility for implementation by 2050.
2. Technological Solutions
Many aircraft manufacturers have investigated the use of alternative and more sustainable fuel
sources, the most notable alternative fuel being electricity; this innovation has the potential to
significantly decrease carbon emissions. We believe that the widespread use of electric and hybrid electric
airplanes in the commercial aviation sector will significantly reduce net carbon emissions from airports.
Likewise, the rise of commercial electric vehicles in recent years demonstrates the possible reliance on
electric support vehicles that are used on the ground at airports. We believe that these will also constitute
a large reduction in carbon emissions, especially as their use is compounded in airports across the world.
In addition, we anticipate that airports will employ the use of advanced infrastructure systems in
order to mitigate unavoidable carbon emissions. For example, the use of direct air capture systems that
can increase the air quality on both airports and surrounding grounds. In this paper, we will discuss these
systems, and how they can be used to decrease net carbon emissions.
a. Electric Aircraft and Vehicles
Recent advances in aircraft technology have led to the electrification of aircraft components that
are traditionally hydraulic or pneumatic. For example, the Boeing 787 and Airbus A380 have pioneered
the use of electrical systems for critical flight functions such as actuation, wing ice protection, and fuel
pumping systems, which have led to reductions in noise pollution and fuel consumption.8 A 2015 study
proposes a “More Electric Aircraft”, which will make all existing systems (except for the engines)
electrically powered. This includes cabin pressurization, which is currently pneumatically powered, fuel
pumping, which is mechanically powered, and hydraulic components such as the flaps and landing gear.
However, by 2050, we predict a widespread use of electric-propulsion and hybrid-electric aircraft.
Electric aircraft have already been in development for many years. One example is the 600 kg Li-ion
powered aircraft capable of flying 160 kph that was proposed in 2013.9 Since then, however, there have
been significant advances. In 2021, Rolls-Royce successfully created and tested the “Spirit of
Innovation”, the fastest all-electric aircraft, which is capable of flying up to 555.9 kph.10 Although many
electric aircraft today have been developed for smaller-scale operations, aircraft manufacturers have
proposed electric and hybrid-electric aircraft models to enter commercial service by 2050. An early
model, the Wright Spirit (proposed to enter service in 2026), will have seating capacity of approximately
100 passengers, and will have enough range to fly 1-hour long flights (for example, the London to France
route).11 The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also anticipates that hybrid electric
aircraft, capable of seating up to 130 passengers, will enter commercial service after 2030.12 For example,
the Boeing Sugar VOLT, proposed to enter service in 2040, will be able to seat 135 passengers and have a
range of over 6000 km.13

The use of electric and hybrid-electric aircraft will lead to significant reductions in carbon
emissions. Compared to airplanes powered by conventional fuel sources with similar seating capacity and
range, electric aircraft could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions and hybrid electric aircraft will lead
to an additional possible reduction. According to researchers at MIT, these improvements can lead to a
92% reduction in air pollution-related deaths caused by the aviation sector.14These electric aircraft may
also replace or partially replace current airplane models that lead to the highest percentage of carbon
emissions worldwide. According to data compiled by the International Council on Clean Transportation,
Regional and Narrowbody airplanes, which seat between 75 and 200 passengers, were responsible for
almost 60% of carbon emissions in the aviation sector.15
Airports can support the adoption of electric aircraft into commercial service by building and
conducting research on electric charging stations to support electric aircraft. Electric charging
infrastructure has seen preliminary usage in airports and testing as of today. For example, in October
2021, Swedish airport operator Swedavia opened 3 aircraft charging stations at a regional airport16.
Trainelli et. al predicts that there will be two main types of charging stations: plug in stations and battery
swapping stations. However, both types of stations experience unique barriers to smooth operations and
quick turnaround time. Plug-in stations are currently infeasible for commercial airports due to their
excessive charging times. Although battery swapping stations have the advantage of being able to charge
batteries while they are not in use, numerous battery charging stations will be required to efficiently
charge and prepare batteries for future flights.17
Several attempts have been made to tackle these challenges. For example, Guo et al. propose a
model that can significantly increase the efficiency and economic feasibility of battery charging by
compiling data on demand for electricity throughout the day.18 However, additional research and
investigations must be conducted before charging stations that are economically feasible for commercial
airports can be built. Airports can help to achieve widespread installation of these charging stations by
2050 by installing and testing current charging station technologies, and conducting research studies on
how to improve station price effectiveness and charging efficiency.
Airports also should prioritize a greater switch to electric ground transport and support vehicles.
On its own, transportation is the fourth largest source of global carbon emissions at 14% of the total, and
the technology already exists for airport transport vehicles to make a greater push towards going
electric.19 Currently, nearly all of the cargo tractors and belt loaders currently in use are gasoline or diesel
powered and most often specifically chosen for the purposes of reliability and low maintenance. General
Motors has announced an initiative to further develop conversion technology, which would allow for the
retrofitted installation of an electric drivetrain into conventionally combustion engine-powered vehicles.
Their announcement of a partnership with Textron Ground Support Equipment Inc. for the specific
development of electric airport ground transportation bolsters the fact that electric-powered ground

support is feasible in the near future.20 Utilizing General Motors’ current incentive toward retrofitting of
current support vehicles, a transition from the combustion-powered cargo and baggage tractors, belt
loaders and tug equipment to electric drivetrains is almost immediately viable.
Airports must also be responsible for the installation of safety equipment and infrastructure for
electric airplanes. As of February 2020, the FAA restricts the transport of Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) Batteries
on any commercial flight. Electric aircraft, which may rely on Li-Ion batteries as their primary power
source, will therefore require additional safety precautions before they can enter into commercial
service21. Gao et. al has shown in their study on flame retardant Li-ion battery storage systems that
thermal runaway retardant (TRR) capsules can help protect Li-ion batteries from fire damage while still
maintaining their electrochemical performance.22 Such capsules have seen significant improvements over
the past few years and have helped to greatly improve the safety of electric vehicles. Capsules can serve
as protective equipment both for airport storage facilities and on-board the aircraft. Airports must also
invest in airport crew training and equipment to effectively fight lithium fires on the ground. Since lithium
fires are difficult to fight compared to conventional fires, airport firefighters must be trained to effectively
respond to on-board lithium fires.23
b. Airport Implementation of Exterior Direct Air Carbon Capture Systems
By 2050, electric and hybrid vehicles will have not entirely phased out the existing fleet of
conventional vehicles.24 To best support green aviation technology of the future, airports must continue to
offset the emissions of conventional airplanes. Direct air capture (DAC) is the name for technologies that
extract CO2 directly from the atmosphere through a series of chemical processes and filters. DAC can
function as both a carbon negative solution, when the captured CO2 is stored in underground geological
formations, or carbon neutral solution when the CO2 is used for industrial, mechanical, or synthetic fuel
purposes. In order for DAC to function as a carbon negative solution, it must minimize its CO2 output in
the form of energy consumption so that the net offset is negative.
Optimizing that offset has proven to be one of the main challenges for engineers. To sequester
enough carbon from the air, most DAC systems today use fans to draw in as much air as possible in order
to maximize the CO2 concentration. As a result the fans draw energy from the grid and the system risks
emitting more CO2 than it is sequestering. We propose that airports take advantage of their unique role as
a large carbon emitting hub and implement DAC systems around the airport.
DAC falls under the category of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS systems have existed
for many years, but it has mainly been implemented in power plants where CO2 emissions are heavily
concentrated, and the captured CO2 can be mechanically used, like recovering oil from the ground or
pneumatically powering machines. DAC is a relatively new concept in climate technology. The first DAC
plant began operating in 2015 through the company Carbon Engineering, and another large scale plant
built by the company Climeworks began operating in 2017 and removes 4000 tons of CO2 per year. The

cost of direct air capture, around $600 per ton, is currently too high to incentivize companies to scale.25
The current technology readiness level of DAC systems is at 7 because the systems have already been
tested. By 2050, DAC systems will be at level 9 with widespread use and scale.
By 2050, however, the cost per ton of sequestering carbon dioxide is expected to decrease
dramatically. A study that reviewed relevant literature and current commercial trends projected that the
cost of DAC could be reduced to $85 per ton of CO2. Combined with a renewable energy infrastructure,
designing a large DAC system will be feasible by 2050.26
Looking at the United States as a possible need and use case study, airports are uniquely
positioned to take advantage of DAC. According to an air travel study done by Upgraded Points, a
consumer travel blog, 29.5 percent of U.S. cities with populations greater than 50,000 people are located
within 25 miles of a large hub (defined as receiving 1% or more of annual enplanements within the
United States.27, 28 Furthermore, a CDC study, Rural and Urban Differences in Air Quality, 2008–2012,
and Community Drinking Water Quality, 2010–2015 — United States, found that rural “counties
experienced fewer unhealthy air-quality days than large central metropolitan counties, likely because of
fewer air pollution sources in the non core counties.”29 Urban cities are on average closer to large hubs
and have higher concentrations of air pollution. Large, concentrated, local populations could directly
benefit from DAC being adopted by large hubs within the United States specifically.
The large hubs are also suited for the physical and electrical demands of DAC systems. Airports
generally encompass large and flat lands with limited vertical obstructions and have large rooftop surfaces
on airport infrastructure including terminals, parking garages, hangers, and transportation facilities.
Airports are also heavily investing in their renewable energy capability, Denver International Airport is
one such example, since 2008 the airport has added 56 acres of solar panel coverage, offsetting up to
11,465 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions yearly.30 With more airports implementing renewable
energy sources, DAC systems could possibly take advantage of carbon neutral energy to become carbon
negative systems and have impacts beyond the airport.
The energy demands of a DAC system are dependent on factors such as the molar concentration
of CO2 in the ambient air and how much the system is running. The amount of energy required for each
ton of carbon sequestration decreases exponentially with an increase in molar concentration.31 Referring
to Appendix 3, ambient air sits on the top of the curve and as a result requires an immense amount of
energy. DAC systems will not be able to substantially get around this challenge, however, DAC systems
can utilize specific ambient conditions to their advantage. Outlined above, emissions from planes, cars,
and the overall size of the airport contributes to high CO2 concentrations around an airport.

A study measuring the emissions from Hartsfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta found that the CO2
concentration around an airport is much higher compared to locations farther away from the airport.32 The
study used the FAA standard Emissions and Dispersion Modeling System and the Here Sparse Matrix
Operator Kernel Emission (SMOKE) system. Appendix 4 shows emissions as a mole fraction over the
course of a day. The fraction peaks at .08 and averages around .05 as the day progresses. Comparing that
to the figure provided by Wilcox, the CO2 concentration is similar to that of a natural gas combustion
point source which requires an exponentially less amount of energy to remove. By positioning carbon
capture systems at airports, the systems could be three times more efficient, making them an excellent
option for supporting the transition to an electric fleet of aircraft.
Airports will employ modular carbon capture systems similar to those of Climeworks, a leader in
the commercial DAC industry with the largest DAC system in operation. Climeworks's DAC system
employs a technology called low temperature solid sorbent direct air capture.33 Ambient air flows into the
system and the CO2 chemically binds to a sorbent filter. Once the sorbent is saturated with CO2, air
intake is cut off and a process called regeneration begins. During regeneration, the system is heated to
100C where the CO2 is purified. The compressed gas is then transferred through a network of pipelines
where it is stored underground.
In terms of implementation, placement, and location of carbon capture systems on airport
grounds, the research team looked to the Federal Aviation Administration's Technical Guidance for
Evaluating Selected Solar Technologies on Airports, we propose both roof and ground mounted DAC
systems. When exploring the viability of DAC systems, space is an important factor. Most airports have
large unused spaces including noise buffers, areas near runways, and rooftops. Rural airports tend to have
more possible citing locations, whereas urban airports may be limited to terminals, parking garages, and
hangers. With either ground or rooftop mounted systems, existing aviation and airport activities must be
evaluated. When designing and implementing DAC systems on airport ground it is important not to
obstruct or impede on air navigation pursuant to 14 CFR Part 77 SAFE, EFFICIENT USE, AND
PRESERVATION OF THE NAVIGABLE AIRSPACE, which is a governing doctrine for construction on
airport grounds.34
Airport buildings (terminals) most often have flat rooms whereas hangers have angled roofs, both
options provide many placement options for direct. Using FAA guidance outlined for mounting solar
panels on airport roofs, a pre-mounting analysis of existing roof capacity is required to determine if the
structure is efficient to hold the extra weight of a DAC, weights are dependent on the number of units,
their size, and other equipment such as piping and mechanicals that are mounted directly on the units or
are an another location.35
Installation of ground-mounted DAC systems, an example seen in Appendix 2, requires mostly
flat terrain with reasonably unobstructed access and exposures. Given the weight of DAC systems and
related components, such as CO2 storage tanks, power inverters, and other associated structures to house
mechanicals, geotechnical analysis may be required to determine the long term soil stability. The lack of

technical difficulty of both engineering and construction of ground systems may also contribute to lower
project costs.36
DAC system designs should take into account site specific environmental factors, such as snow
removal, hail storms, and high hurricane and tornado force wind loads. DAC systems should meet
applicable building code standards and all DAC systems should be equipped with lightning protection
measures.
Possible benefits to airports include achieving carbon neutral and or negative status, the ability to
sell carbon allotments to airlines, companies, and other customers, as well as industrial or CO2 storage.
Currently, DAC systems can cost in the hundreds of millions and the team recommends public / private
partnerships. As DAC systems grow in popularity they will be coming to more and more areas, airports
are in a key position to be able to incorporate them into their infrastructure and design(s).
3. Conclusion and Discussion
After extensively reviewing existing research regarding ways airports contribute to carbon
emissions, types of carbon emissions, aviation infrastructure types, and technology readiness scores, our
team chose three technology categories that will have promising impacts on the airports of tomorrow.
As battery technology improves and electric vehicles begin to match the efficiency and cost of
conventional fossil fuels, electric vehicles will begin to swap out their counterparts, both on the ground
and in the sky. This will require major infrastructural updates so airports can facilitate charging, battery
maintenance, battery storage, and battery combustion.
Furthermore, instead of investing in passive infrastructure that reduces emissions and increases
sustainability by choosing the greener option over another, airports can incorporate direct air capture
systems to become active carbon negative organizations. Explored through a high level case study of large
hub airports within the United States, carbon capture systems will have both positive economic and
environmental ramifications for airports and their surrounding areas.
The design for the airports of tomorrow begins with an understanding and assessment of the
technologies of today. The research team hopes that our novel, yet implementable solutions will help
airports lead the way for a greener and cleaner future.",,,,,,,,,

There is a trend toward personalization not just in technology and services but in physical appearance with humans opting for implants. In the future gene editing may enable people to customize not just appearance but abilities. Legalization of formerly banned substances such as marijuana may also pose hiring quandaries to more traditional organizations. Services are managed via platforms and assets are distributed globally. Yet, each community has different needs.Privacy preserving networks are in development for distributed model training. Tokenization and SSID may also play a role.

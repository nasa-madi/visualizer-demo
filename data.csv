How might we minimize crash landing drones and air vehicles?,Wicked Wild,High,"Provide redundant landing capabilities to UAVs to increase safety and public confidence in these systems. This will allow the economy to expand with the capabilities UAVs promise while managing the risks associated with their overflight of valuable assets and humans. We can take the next step to build on the success of Safe2Ditch intelligent landing system by adding backup propulsion and guidance to increase the options for a safe ditching and more precisely control the crash and mitigate damage/injury. Perform a analysis of available electric, pressure, 
and rocket powered systems that can be added to drones to supplement 
damaged systems and controlled by the Safe2Ditch system to expand its 
ability to reduce the danger from ditching UAVs","Today I'd like to propose rails, which is retro assisted intelligent landing study. In the future, UAV's will be used in various environments to accomplish many tasks. These environments will have people present, and this presents at risk because of the risk NASA has developed detecting the void software to recognize unsafe situations and avoid landing in these zones. However, like any other machine, US will eventually fail or malfunction. When this happens, the vehicle has no control over where it lands or crashes.
So this video shows the test we performed terminating the vehicle mid flight in order to mitigate the risk of an uncontrollable UAV crashing into people, we'd like to propose a device which can steer the vehicle away from people or unsafe crash zones. I think the three steps to this number one, the vehicle will shut up. I'll pulsion so it becomes ballistic and follows a more predictable flight path to the onboard detect and avoid software will determine whether this crash zone is problematic. 3rd the detecting avoid software will determine the safest crash zone and finally a device will deploy to direct the crashing vehicle to the safest crash location. Clearly, the biggest question here is whether a device could be developed to actually affect the trajectory of an out of control vehicle. This will require analysis and testing to determine feasibility of this concept, and it'll be limited to vehicles under 55 pounds. We did investigate propulsion device options that would meet the physical requirements for the small US installation and gather real time or real world data on how much force they can impart for objects of various inertias. So here's our engineering approach. In order to address this problem, we'd like to use the phased engineering approach to solve this problem. Phase one would be hardware testing and data collection. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Phase two is vehicle simulation using phase one data to assess the impact of propulsive options on the trajectory management of the following vehicles. If results indicate feasible impact to the trajectory analysis of application to risk reduction technologies like grasp and real time risk assessment could be done. If the results look promising, phase two would follow. Face you follow Phase three is validation testing with drop testing of objects with similar inertial characteristics as drones from the gantry with active propulsors to validate simulation runs. We believe this would have significant impacts on industries which require small UIS to integrate with them populated environments. The outcome of this work could inform the FA on beyond visual line of sight flights and rules regarding autonomous systems."
How might we harvest energy and shield against radiation with melanin?,Wicked Wild,Medium,"Commercial aircraft use about 100 MW of electricity. All that electricity must be generated by the aircraft. This require converting fuel to electricity that results in a reduction of aircraft efficiency. If some portion of that energy could be harvested without the expenditure of fuel that would increase aircraft efficiency. Aircraft operate at high altitudes where UV radiation and cosmic radiation levels are much greater than at ground level. This radiation represents a source of energy that remains unharvested. This free energy could be used to increase the energy efficiency of aircraft while reducing passenger exposure to harmful radiationMelanin is known mostly as a pigment but is a multifunctional material that accels at adsorbing UV and cosmic radiation that make it ideal for energy harvesting applications.  Melanin panels could harvest energy to supplement power. ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:Investigate the ability of natural and synthetic melanin’s to adsorb energy and produce electricity  for aerospace applications.","bioinspired melanin based energy harvesting pitch. The basic premise behind this proposal is that commercial aircraft are huge consumers of electricity and every single water that electricity has to be generated by the aircraft itself.
And we know that, you know, whenever we take something like jet fuel and convert it to some other form of energy, like electricity, it's not perfect. There it's, you know, there are losses involved and that comes at the expense of efficiency to the aircraft.
So is there, you know, some way where we could possibly augment or supplement the energy that is around the aircraft and possibly generate some electricity to help these aircraft become more fuel efficient? Now, one of the things is is that because commercial aircraft, you know, they typically fly at very high altitudes and in clear Sky early because they're they're up above the clouds.
The UV radiation at altitude is about 100% greater than what we experience here at ground level.
And cosmic radiation is continuously bombarding earth with about 1 giga electron volts or with energies of about 1 gig electron volts at the rate of about 10,000 per square meter every 2nd. And this happens day and night. So even aircraft flying night time routes or even in cloud clouds, you know, and it's not reliant strictly on on solar energy, but in cosmic energy is is Sir no. So if some portion of that energy, which right now just hits an aircraft and and goes unused, it some part of that could be harvested and converted into electrical energy that could be put back into the aircraft, that would help aircraft. Ohh efficiency. And so you know, how could that be accomplished? Well, you know, the whole idea of energy harvesting isn't new. You know, we have plenty of examples of that currently on Earth, you know, from hydroelectric dams, wind farm, solar farms. All of those take existing energy and harvest it and convert it into electrical energy. One of the things that is our our materials that has been under the radar but is extremely common is melanin. 
Melanin is simply known, or or mostly known, just as a dark brown or a black pigment, and you know helps give us our skin color and and protect us from sunburn. However, that's not really doing melon and much justice. It really is a biopolymer that is amazingly multifunctional. Uh, and it's a macromolecular material, which is a mouthful to say that excels at transforming uh energy, particularly energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, from an A broad portion of that, all the way from like, near infrared to real short wavelength energy like UV and cosmic energy into electricity. Well and and it and it does it through a two stage process. First, it converts it uh into heat, which is exactly why when we go out into the sunlight and and sunlight feels warm, the melanin in our skin is immediately absorbing that energy, converting it to heat, and then it eventually converts it to electricity. So the idea of this is that melanin it's ideally suited for energy harvesting applications, so if we could, you know, and as I show in a in the PowerPoint here, you know if we could coat the top surface or or part of a fuselage with basically melanin based energy harvesting panels and and convert that energy that impacts on those surfaces kind of like a solar cell for an airplane or a type of thing, then it could go into the electrical system of the aircraft and basically you know we know that you know in commercial aircraft you.
Know cost of operation and efficiency you know is is tremendous and so. You know the operators of commercial aircraft are looking for, you know, even fractional increases in efficiency. Uh to help generate and and maintain profitability as. So the wicket idea is to basically investigate a proof of concept melanin based energy absorber to produce electricity. The beauty of this concept is it's simplicity in which this can idea can be investigated. At this low TRL level, synthetic and organic melanin are commercially available through readily available sources. You could coat a substrate with a thin film of melanin and expose it to UV light, and then monitor that sample for the generation of electrical signal. Demonstrating some basic proof of concept that would set the stage for more formal research and development of melon and based energy absorbers for aeronautic applications."
How might we enable trust in AI/ML applications and development,Wicked Wild,Low,"AI/ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AI/ML systems are very attractive targets [1]. An IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications [2]. A 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft, and adversarial samples [3]. AI/ML systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks across development, deployment, and inference. Enabling technologies: Public-key Encryption, Digital Signatures, Zero-knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption, etc..
Characteristics that build trust: AI/ML systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy. Development of verifiable A/ML standards and regulations that rely on cryptographic guarantees to replace trust in companies.
Use cases:
Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML)
Problem: How to validate AI/ML accuracy of services on a public data set without exposing model weights and providing assurances related to training data
Solution: Zero Knowledge proofs
Proof of Inference
Problem: How to verify that an AI/ML service provider is running inference on the proper model and not cheaper model 
(e.g. how to verify openAI is giving you results from chatGPT-4 and not chatGPT-3?) without exposing weights. Implications for 
AI/ML certification (e.g. how to verify model predictions are from certified model without exposing weights).
Solution: Zero Knowledge proofs
Privacy Preserving ML
Problem: How to train AI/ML models with sensitive data at large data centers while ensuring privacy 
Solution: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabling compute on encrypted data
Data Provenance in Pipelines
Problem: How to ensure that data inputs (e.g. images from a camera) are not compromised from attackers or pipelines
Solution: Hardware attestation and provenance to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of hardware components and data
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: 
Cryptographic primitives can be combined with AI/ML development and applications to provide strong guarantees across 
data pipelines, model development, model validation, and inference while maintaining privacy [1].

","the context for today's presentation is that AI ML was not originally designed for adversarial contexts, yet AIML systems remain very attractive targets for these kind of adversarial attacks. So industry has kind of been looking at this and we I put here some examples where an IEEE survey from May 2020 found that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications. And similarly, a 2019 Gartner report found that application leaders must anticipate and prepare to mitigate potential risks of data corruption, model theft and adversarial examples.
So the key idea here is that AI ML systems are vulnerable to these adversarial attacks across the entire life cycle of development, deployment and inference. So you know, the idea here is that there's this intersection of AI, ML, and cryptography, and there's many different kind of business sectors that live at this intersection.
And we can kind of leverage some of these enabling technologies from cryptography such as public key encryption, data signature, zero knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption. And there's all these other ones as well. And so the idea is that leveraging these kind of cryptographic primitives would enable us to build trust in systems and enforce good behavior as opposed to relying on trusting some entity or company or third party. So characteristics that build trust in these systems are that AI Mel systems should enforce honest behavior through cryptographic tools while maintaining privacy.
And that's a big key. Their privacy and that, you know, the idea here is that development of verifiable AIML standards and regulations that rely on these cryptographic guarantees can replace trusting companies.
So some simple examples just to give some intuition behind the ideas here is that you know, everybody's probably used open AI's chat GPT. So when you send a request to chat GPT, how do you know that the answer you get back is from the correct model?
So say that you're a subscriber to their premium service. You pay $10.00 a month to get access to chat GPT 4 when open AI returns their response. How do you know that they're running inference on chat GPT 4 as opposed to a cheaper model that might be more kind of profitable from a business perspective? Well, the answer is that you don't know you are putting trust in open AI to do the right thing. So some the examples here of different use cases are one that I just talked about here was the 2nd bullet, which is proof of inference. So the idea there is that, you know, you can leverage some of these cryptographic tools to validate or verify that you ran inference on the correct model. Some other use cases are, you know, let's say a company says, hey, I have some machine learning model, it was this accurate. How do you how do you verify that their performance on some data set is what they claim, while in both those situations you can use these cryptographic tools called 0 knowledge proofs?
There's other tools that you can use, such as fully homomorphic encryption, that enable privacy preserving mill so you can do the idea there is you can encrypt data, send to a large data center, do compute on your encrypted data and get back the answer that you had to begin with. And then now there's some other ideas about kind of by hardware attestation and provenance to ensure integrity of data that are running through your pipelines. So ultimately the wicked wild idea here is that cryptographic primitives can be combined with a aiml development and applications to provide strong guarantees across data pipelines, model development, model validation and inference while maintaining privacy."
How might we improve airborne communication with Vortex Beam Communication for Interference Mitigation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity:
Desirability: We are addressing the spectrum scarcity problem in the context of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM).
Viability: Our solution makes use of a spatial filtering technique, which we are currently demonstrating in the laboratory under an existing NASA project aimed at low Earth orbit (LEO) to terrestrial communication.
Feasibility: Adoption of our method will require some changes to communication infrastructure; however, the ability to communicate in the presence of in-band interference could change the paradigm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication standards.
Key Use Cases: Any case involving line-of-sight communication links that cannot take advantage of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) schemes, which rely on multipath propagation.
Possible Partnerships: Florida International University, University of Akron, Xadite Perceptions, Department of Defense (DoD)

“Wicked-Wild” Idea:
Exploit the orthogonality of vortex beams to allow for simultaneous usage of specific portions of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
Isolate data channels using spatial-domain filtering techniques as opposed totraditional frequency-filtering techniques.
Increase data transfer volume by using multiple vortex beams of the same carrier frequency.
","thank you so advanced air mobility or ATM is the future of air transportation that explores the development of new technologies to revolutionize airspace usage and is a rapidly developing field that will include low altitude passenger transport, cargo delivery and public service capabilities. However, because the radio spectrum is a limited resource to increase of aircraft in the air, space raises concerns about potential interference with aviation communication.
This increased disruption of critical communication and navigation signals can be caused by a variety of factors, both internal and external, to aviation systems.
In severe cases, radiofrequency or RF interference caused by unintentional emissions or deliberate jamming can lead to important safety risks.
Here is how vortex beam communication stands as a promising solution to interference mitigation in the context of AM are are at vortex harnesses, an underutilized property of radio waves.
Their orbital angular momentum or OEM, the angular momentum of an of an electromagnetic or yam wave is composed of two parts, spin angular momentum corresponding to depolarization of the emwave and orbital angular momentum OAM associated to the spatial distribution of the EM wave. This integer value defines the number of helical terms the wavefront makes around the propagation axis.
By tailoring the antenna ray to generate a desired oil mode, say plus one, we can transmit a targeted beam.
Only receiver is equipped to detect the plus one mode will be able to decode the information.
Now visualized data traveling on an invisible highway for each lane is defined by distinct helical twist in the signal itself.
This twist, characterized by the OEM, forms the foundation for a powerful technique known as spatial multiplexing, which allows for the transmission of multiple independent data streams on the same frequency.
By utilizing the spatial domain, we overcome interference limitations inherent to current RF systems.
The orthogonality of OAM modes unlocks a dramatic increase in data capacity for applications previously limited by bandwidth constraints.
But beyond share capacity Re Vortex offers unique addressing capabilities.
Each OEM mode has a specific topological charge acting as its unique identifier or fingerprint.
Imagine beams with charges, for example plus one and -2.

In crowded environments with many RF signals.
OEM filtering allows receivers to focus on their specific OEM fingerprint, ignoring irrelevant signals and thus reducing interference while enabling targeted information delivery with high signal to noise ratio and accuracy.
Overall, encoding data on OEM modes consists of an information signal modulating the electric field of the RF wave.
By carefully manipulating the phase distribution across the wavefront, thus creating specific OEM modes carrying the encoded data, the then multiple OEM modes carrying different data streams can be superimposed and transmitted together.
Specialized antenna arrays at the receiving end can then separate these modes based on their unique face patterns, all of which makes this vortex beam communication technology hold the key to reshaping the way the data is transferred and interference mitigated in a soon to be crowded airspace."
How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation. 
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: Develop HT-PEM technology for aviation
Using HT-PEM fuel cells to power electric aircraft eliminates CO2 emissions while sustaining timely, long-distance travel capability. 
Develop HT-PEM fuel cell materials specifically for aviation 
Focus on membranes, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA)
Include other stack components as opportunities allow
Test HT-PEM fuel cell materials, single cells, and cell stacks under aviation load profiles (high-power flight condition for take off and climb, low ambient air temperature and very dry air at high elevation, etc.)
Demonstrate HT-PEM FC energy efficiency and CO2 emission reductions","the pitch is high temperature PEM Fuel cell for aviation.
Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.
It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.
it is the importance into the air and contributing to global warming, the high energy efficiency of fuel may offset the lower energy density of hydrogen.
Therefore comparable few compare size of fuel tank can be used for similar flying distance of country airplane. You're placing.
Engine with a highly efficient fuel cell is a great option.
It means the size of fuel tank and the frying range of current airplane and also completely eliminated the imaging their causes, global warming and protect air. The Department of Energy is developing high temperature paint fusia for ground transportation, especially for heavy duty vehicle.
The pitch this piece is for developing the similar technology for aviation.
The developments are where you focus on material specific for aviation application, such as membranes, electrodes, membrane electrode assembly and other stack components to measure the progress of this activity.
High temperature pain, fuel cell stacks and system will be tested under the aviation load profile. The result will be used to modify and optimize fuel cell system for aviation application.
The results are important for the design of future policy system for electrified, electrified airplane."
"Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST)",Wicked Wild,High,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science/engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.
What if…we could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by
 improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety, and efficiency using lightweight polymer aerogels
Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage
Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy
","So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten.
It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks.
So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport.
This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.

Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95% large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly.
You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft."
How might we cool next gen aircraft?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity:Sustainable aviation is a key initiative for NASA and the world to address climate change and protect the environment. An opportunity is presented to leverage inherent thermal generation in aircraft operation, typically seen as waste, to support electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation.
Key Use Cases: Assist with thermal management, structural health monitoring, lighting systems, and de-icing.
Possible Partnerships: Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Joby, FAA, and more.  ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: 
Future aircraft will be fully integrated closed-loop systems:
Wasted energy from thermal, motion, and other energy sources will     
        be harvested for secondary functions to:
Enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives
Demonstrate integrated thermal management systems
Enable comprehensive structural health management
Energy harvesting will enable extended operations, reduce cost, reduce strain on systems, provide redundancy, and compliment ongoing sustainability efforts.
Leverage energy harvesting systems to support aircraft functions, optimize operational and energy efficiency through integrated systems, improve safety, and reduce waste.
Energy harvesting technologies and advanced materials are available, along with an opportunity to drive change in advanced air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion.
","I'm talking about heat generation. That's inherent to any process, and specifically in this context, the excess heat generated throughout an aircraft as NASA and countries around the globe look to sustainable aviation to address greener climate and environmental initiatives, we can also shift our perspective on heat generated by engines, batteries and other aircraft components from being a detriment or a flaw to the generated heat being designed feature. Here we have an opportunity to employ energy harvesting as part of an integrated multifunctional system to support our electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation, as well as moving a few degrees closer to closing the loop on sustainability. With that, we can address the desirability, viability and feasibility of taking on this opportunity.
As for the desirability, or do they want this energy conversion technology, this technologies as a part of an integrated aircraft system is not a new concept. NASA and companies like Boeing have previously demonstrated interest in the area at the bottom right, doctor Arun Malay of Boeing laid out an aircraft system map to demonstrate the potential of a thermal management system to capture and utilize generated heat, and even now with the the electrification, the aviation batteries introduced a significant source of thermal energy. That one harvested could support secondary systems while simultaneously mitigating and preventing thermal runaway and catastrophic damage. Supported systems could further include comprehensive structural health monitoring, lighting and deicing.
And this all contributes towards energy harvesting, enabling extended operations, reduce costs, reduce strain on systems, providing redundancy and complementing ongoing sustainability efforts. As for viability, or should we do this leveraging integrated energy harvesting? Harvesting systems will support aircraft functions, optimize operational and energy efficiency through integrated systems, improve safety and reduce waste, has for feasibility. Or can we do this? The technologies in advanced materials are available along with an opportunity to drive change in advance air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion. While they're still in the early stages of development, so with that, though wicked wild idea proposed here is a world where aircraft are multifunctional, fully integrated closed loop systems possibly. Imagine the nervous system of a body completely connected and optimized to regulate temperature and subsystem functions and aviation wasted energy from thermal motion and other energy sources will be harvested for secondary functions to enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives. Demonstrate integrated thermal management systems and enable comprehensive structural health management and we here at NASA have the multidisciplinary expertise needed to solve this challenge and make an impactful change to the state of green aviation.

How might we improve temperature monitoring for electrified vehicles using Optical Fiber?,Wicked Wild,Super High,"Electrified Air Mobility Vehicles can reduce carbon emission currently facing aerospace industry
Currently Air transportation is around 2% of overall carbon emission
But since vehicle emit carbon high in the sky, it’s causing 5% of global warming effect
Two types of electrify vehicle – both has a temperature issue
Battery-Electric vehicle – traditional battery utilizing Li-Ion based chemistry, where precise battery health (via temperature monitoring) is critical to the vehicle.
Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicle – By converting on-board hydrogen fuel into electricity via fuel-cell technology, the power-density of such vehicle is greater than battery-electric vehicle
Temperature distribution across the fuel cell is critical for vehicle health
Temperature monitoring across LH2 fuel line to ensure no leakage
Overall temperature monitoring of electric vehicle
Either battery of fuel-cell generate high current, needed for electric motors to function, and these high current wiring needs active cooling for vehicle safety operation. Wicked Wild Pitch
Optical Fiber for electric-vehicle temperature sensing
Completely Optical – Won’t cause or affected by EMI
High Spatial Density – multiple sensors cascaded onto one fiber for FEM level temperature gradient monitoring","Today I want to propose the idea of using optical fiber for temperature sensing for electric 5 vehicles. Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle.
Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e.
Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation.
Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen.
You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical.
It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal.
Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery.
You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire.
Now you have you you have a temperature distribution every half inch interval across your your airplane."

How might we democratize the Medical Supply chain through aviation? 
How might we regulate drones/democratized aviation in the future medical supply chain? 
Why is this a problem? 
The use of drones, or unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), in supply chain management (SCM) and logistics has a range of potential strengths: (1) support of humanitarian logistics, (2) reduced delivery time, (3) reduced cost, (4) improved flexibility, and (5) increased sustainability. However, large numbers of drones may affect other aircraft operating in the same local airspace, the infrastructure for the introduction of a significant number of drone systems does not exist, and there are significant number of regulatory and safety issues involved. Lack of technical expertise within regulating bodies on these subjects. And, there are a couple of real technological barriers that are wicked hard and nobody has tackled them [REF - The Big Case for Small UAS Access to the National Airspace System.pdf (sharepoint.com)]. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
UTM (Unmanned aerial system Traffic Management) system is being developed by NASA and FAA to safely and efficiently integrate drone operations into the national airspace system where other vehicles also fly. Increasing the capability of individual drones towards more complete on-board situational awareness to avoid safety hazards or impact to the airspace can shift the problem from one of centralized management to one of self-managed systems that do not require human intervention. SBIR (GH). 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
More advanced management capabilities of the air space will allow improved safety and efficiency. Technology development of drone and vehicle artificial intelligence, autonomy, internal/external vehicle situational awareness can impact drone capabilities on an individual level. Overall, the introduction of drones into the air space will change the nature of the airspace and begin the early phase of addressing these individual drone operational challenges 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
The broad introduction of drones into the air space not only near airports but across vast regions of the country impacting supply management changes the nature of commerce on the broad level. This ranges from employment in new areas of aviation technical support to the availability of medical supplies in hospitals across the country.

"How might the entire aviation experience be restructured to reduce its risk as a vector of pathogen transmission? (reducing unnecessary contact, etc.)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Why is this a problem? 
The drive to reduce human interaction in aviation has at least 2 influencing factors: The attempt to safeguard public health from the spread of contagions; and an economic drive towards automation to decrease staffing and expense associated with airline and the airport employees. However, this can lead to the depersonalization of air travel and, depending on the efficiency of the automation, potential inefficiencies in handling customer complaints/problems as well as removing a public face representing and individual airline company. 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134995/ 
https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1223&context=wmblr 
If the aviation industry is a major vector for pathogen transmission, it will continue to generate global pandemics as strict border control will be more porous than otherwise. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem?
At the very least, the interactions of automated system should be at least as efficient as human based customer service. This implies improved artificial intelligence be implemented so that either unexpected events can be addressed or quickly re-routed to human staffing.
Additional interfaces need to be designed to be pathogen resistant in case cleaning is less effective or skipped.
Standard, practiced changes to routing and operations if pathogens are detected or a higher risk of transmission.
Additional changes to cabin design to mitigate risk.
Airport redesign to reduce transmission while waiting in line, etc.
Deployable pathogen detection inside airports and airplanes (i.e. next gen temperature guns, mid-flight pathogen testing).
Personal Pods for breathing to keep passengers safe from other passengers Hyundai’s AV pod concepts promise better living through modularity - CNET 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solutioning?  
(Worker to Passenger vectors) Automated check-in and self-serve kiosks have already become a standard aspect of flight service. This drive to minimize staffing and increase automation in customer service is already happening across multiple industries. Increasing automation and autonomous systems may result in airports in which the process is fully automated and one does not have to interact with a member of the airline or airport staff in order to board the plane. 
(Passenger to Passenger) Use of masks and availability of sanitizing wipes or fluids, post COVID, will set cultural norms to reduce P2P transmission.  
(Passenger to Worker) The current staffing shortages and union fights for airline staff may drive additional investments in safety technology to keep pilots and flight attendants healthy and safe.

4.5 B passengers fly per year globally. The percentage of people get sick from 1st or 2nd order connection to flying is really hard to find. There is moderate consensus around the 2-row rule on commercial crafts at a 13% infectivity rate for COVID, but not generally for all pathogens. Our research confirms that more research is needed. At a minimum we believe the population is 100M, but could be 1B.

A review of the literature”, a 2018 paper the actual quote shows the limitations and variability of attempting to bracket this number: - “All studies collected data through either extraction from the medical record, weekly diaries, or pre- and post-travel questionnaires. Data collection timeframes varied by study. Between 6–87% of travelers became ill across all studies. Four studies provided the best estimate: between 43–79% of travelers who frequently visited developing nations (e.g. India, Tanzania, and Kenya) became ill” https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5825178/

Wickedness? CAS-worthy?
This may be a technological progression that will first be implemented in the range of other industries before it reaches aviation. This may not be CAS-worthy problem because the market is already addressing automation (for costs).
But from the pathogen side and from the in-the-tube spread, automation doesn’t account for all interactions and may not even shield people from the most common mechanisms of pathogen transmission (because we don’t know what they are). From that perspective, CAS may have an valid entry point. There may be aircraft design and technology investments specific to the aircraft that may be worthwhile IF the pathogen transmissions is validated as a big problem. (See Capabilities list). ",

Why is this a problem? 
Large portions of the US population, particularly those with the greatest health challenges, do not participate in clinical research studies and thus do not benefit from those discoveries. Low accrual issues overall are the cause of 55% of terminated clinical trials. This lack of representation compromises generalizability, hinders innovation, impacts trust in the medical system, and compounds health disparities of communities without access. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Often, clinical trials are centered around academic or research institutions limiting participation by a broader sampling of the population. Capabilities to address this problem revolve around improving the ability for patients to participate, or, effectively, bringing the clinical trial to the patients. 
For example, travel impacts out-of-pocket costs to patients, typically driving remote patients out of studies. Distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established as a cause of lack participation by rural communities. 
Thus, one capability to improve participation would be to increase the accessibility to transportation in rural communities. 
Further, telemedicine and virtual or localized trial treatments may broaden the geographic diversity. 
While some aspects of this transformation are more related to overall trends in health care technology, the ability to provide well equipped mobile airborne laboratories could impact the ability to increase participation in clinical trials in rural communities. 
Beyond issues related to location, there is in general a lack of participation by racial and ethnic minority populations for a variety of socio-economic reasons. Specific outreach may be required to these populations, so investment in greater capabilities in community coordination. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation to allow more democratized transportation and the ability to bring more comprehensive health care capabilities, including clinical trial participation, no I don’t to remote regions; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. 
The trend in cost of flying will dictate further difficulties in equity. Cost has decreased over multiple decades, but may be stabilizing now (need to confirm).

Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
Very High - 1 Billion 
US Participation was 28% of the total representation in global Clinical trials in 2015. The problem in the US is also then a global representation problem. With personalized genetic mods, medicine, this will become worse. With Climate change, disease and medical impacts will also worsen in the most distressed areas and populations (not currently studied). Specific rural communities are impacted by this problem already within the US. For example, distance as a driver of disparity has been specifically established for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations who are more likely to live far away from research centers. 
Academic centers conduct 55% of the NIH extramural research and operate 98% of the cancer centers. Participation in these activities is biased by the proximity to these centers. However, more broadly, effective clinical trials as a method for improved treatment and drug development has an impact on the population as a whole. Limiting the effectiveness of these trials because of a lack of participation by significant population subgroups narrows the trial’s impact and reduces benefits to society beyond the immediate drug and research.

Problem Scoping: 
Two divergent Healthcare Scenarios: 
Medical treatments become cost-effective enough to move to or stay in local hospitals, lessening the need for travel. 
Medical treatments become less cost-effective (or some do) to the point that treatment centers consolidate and are farther away from patients on average. This is the more likely scenario given the trends in health-apps, investing, travel nurses, minute-clinics, hospital funding problems. 
Given scenario (2), there are two Aviation Scenarios: 
Personal Air mobility or commercial aviation drops in cost sufficiently to counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Medical treatment (tools/supplies) become small enough and cheap enough to ship TO the patient, possibly by air (air hospital?) and counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Sub Problems: 
Does the shift to outpatient clinics reduce the availability of hospitals offering complex procedures and put greater need on air travel for the critically ill? 
Population is more distributed (remote work), so will more people be farther away from centralized services that cannot be financially solvent in closer facilities? 
Will the advancement or cost-efficiency of treatments drop enough to distribute healthcare to local clinics?

As medical health care technology becomes more advanced, the cost of health care more expensive, and population more widely distributed, aviation may have an increasing effect on the accessibility of health care. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Aviation can provide services in the future that are presently either centralized or provided by a range of other transportation. The challenge will be to right-size and optimize the aviation capability to the needs of the health care problem. 
Transportation of medicine via UAVs with appropriate temperature/atmosphere/humidity control which can provide timely delivery, 
Airborne ambulances that can transport while providing care. 
Transportation of medical equipment to remote areas (on a rotation? As part of a pre-planned schedule?). 
Miniaturization of health tech 
More temp-stable medical goods that can survive rougher transport. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation ranging from the advent of personalized air vehicles to package delivery UAVs allowing a series of options for both human and package delivery; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. These trends are counterbalanced by ever increasing healthcare costs that may limit patient access. 
Telehealth – making people more comfortable with remote healthcare 
Robotic Telehealth – letting doctors stay where they are but keep robots local for surgery, etc. 
Cheaper diagnostics - reducing the need for travel to find out if you have a problem, reserving travel to treatment.’ 
Medical Tourism – will the cost and accessibility of medical tourism counterbalance the need for rural access. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
This is ANOTHER way that discrepancies between rural vs urban healthcare is mitigated by aviation. We scoped this to 100M because we believe that smaller procedures will become more accessible/local, but not ALL procedures. So globally, we believe that 100M people will be impacted or make decisions about treatment and safety based on access and cost. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? 
Score: 4-5 Majority 4 (given the costs and advanced nature of the treatments), but small percentage will be 5s, where care is absolutely critical to immediate survival. 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
We are assuming that the geographic consolidation of healthcare continues to the point that access is reduced. If that trend continues, we are confident aviation will be a greater player in access. If not, the question is moot. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy? 
It is suggested that this is a CAS-worthy problem. It is Wicked covering technical, political, societal, economic, and legal issues. It directly involves aerospace across the spectrum of vehicles. The range of technical challenges related to this topic are formidable spanning the range of NASA technologies. Other players in the market may influence parts of the system, but no one technology or solution can mitigate the entire issue of rural access. ",
"How might aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to heavy metal manufacturing and usage? (advanced manufacturing, airport safety protocols, and aircraft design)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Sibling Question: 
How will aviation mitigate growth of drug resistant bacteria due to increased usage of antimicrobials in response to COVID-19? (airport safety protocols, and aircraft design) 
Why is this a problem?
Drug resistant bacteria is propagated by the use of heavy metals (lead, mercury, and silver) because of mining and transportation usage. Bacteria have evolved to resist the presence of these heavy metals, producing traits that also shield them from antibiotics. 
Normally heavy metals are lethal to bacteria because of the free emission of ions that disrupt cell functions. 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health and development threat. It requires urgent multisectoral action in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
WHO has declared that AMR is one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. 
Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. 
Lack of clean water and sanitation and inadequate infection prevention and control promotes the spread of microbes, some of which can be resistant to antimicrobial treatment. 
The cost of AMR to the economy is significant. In addition to death and disability, prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays, the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted. 
Without effective antimicrobials, the success of modern medicine in treating infections, including during major surgery and cancer chemotherapy, would be at increased risk. 
“The site contained a strain of bacteria resistant to 70 percent of antibiotics tested against it.” heavy metal toxicity. Ultrasound was needed for the diagnosis of obstetric and intra-abdominal conditions. Further, screening for a ride range of cancers needs to be increased notably.""

Improper cold chain handling - 50% of all temp excursions due to airport handling – drive medical costs 
Lost opportunity for aviation industry to participate in the medical products transport chain. Lack of standardization across the aviation industry has seen the medical cargo transportation sector losing out to other modes of transportation, such as road and sea. 
This can be addressed by restoring reliability and safety across the medical cargo supply chain. 
The primary issue is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive medical cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
The whole supply chain in the air cargo industry involves a lot of handling points of the cargo. 
There are a lot of different stakeholders that handle the cargo and each individual link in the chain needs to be up to standard, otherwise the whole quality of the supply chain can be lost.

But despite an increasing demand for transporting medicine worldwide, the sector has been falling behind other modes of transportation such as shipping or road, due to a lack of compliance, standardization, accountability and transparency across the supply chain. The air cargo share of global pharma products transport has declined from 17% in 2000 to 11% in 2013, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) notes. 
The reason behind the decline is the difficulty of handling temperature-sensitive cargo across the entire supply chain in a safe and secure manner. 
Over 50% of all temperature excursions occur while products are in the hands of airlines and airports, according to IATA, which renders the products worthless or even dangerous for patients. 
However, according to the Seabury Group, just 0.5 million tonnes of pharmaceutical products are transported by air every year, compared to 3.5 million tonnes by sea. 
Annual product losses associated with these problems range from $2.5-$12.5bn, a figure that IATA describes as “unacceptably high in a $300 billion a year market”.** _ 
The World Health Organization estimates that up to 50% of vaccines are wasted globally every year; a large part because of lack of temperature control and the logistics to support an unbroken cold-chain. 
At the scale of COVID-19, this spoilage rate could waste potentially a billion vaccines, which, even if valued at a non-profit cost of around $10 a vaccine, represents a staggering wasted investment. 
Cracking the cold chain challenge is key to making vaccines ubiquitous (theconversation.com) 
The vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, is often used as the key metric for global vaccination coverage because it is a good indicator for access to routine immunization services. 13.5 million children were not vaccinated in 2018.

"How might medical ethics (Bodily Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice) conflict with aviation/transportation autonomy, distributed monitoring and services?",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Rewording Option: 
Something like: How will medical ethics need to change/adapt/evolve (if needed) in order for (medical related?) services such as autonomous aerial transport, distributed monitoring (over area, inside vehicle) to be accepted and deployed? 
Will current medical ethics (if remain unchanged) help or hinder the development/adoption of medical related aviation services such as autonomous transport (of goods or patients), and healthcare delivery and monitoring? 
Sub Problems: 
How does autonomy impact healthcare? How does autonomy of an aviation-based transport conflict with medical ethics? 
How will medical ethics interface with advancements in aviation (PAM, AAM, distributed monitoring/services, autonomous drones, etc?) 
Why is this a problem? 
This is a subset of a broader set of problems associated with the introduction of new technology and it’s impact on patient health. This scenario is different from conventional usage of air transportation that traditionally involves significant human in the loop interactions. Rather, to the extent that autonomous and automated systems become an aspect of health care, a new set of medical ethics concerns arise. Patient monitoring is necessary during medical transport. If this involves an autonomous or automated transportation system, then That patient information resides with in that autonomous or automated system and it needs to be handled appropriately. Timely delivery of supplies and services by whatever means is a core foundation of health care. If an autonomous or automated system fails in its designated function, that failure just impacts individual health care and an understanding of responsibility or liability is needed_. Broadly speaking, issues involved are: 
Privacy 
Local regulations, laws 
Decision making 
Medical transport 
Liability 
Maximizing patient care 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
There are two aspects of this problem. The first is technical regarding the capability of an autonomous or automated system the carry out its function in an optimized fashion minimizing impact to patient health. The second is the framework of legal and societal restrictions that impose upon the autonomous or automated system a layer of functionality that, for example, ensures confidentiality of patient information or appropriate response in emergency condition. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
One trend is that health care on a local level is becoming increasingly more distributed and advanced. The complexity of health care provided by, for example, emergency air evacuation services has increased over the years. The overall trend is that more can be done locally rather than in a centralized hospital setting. A second trend is changes in the air transportation system is envisioned over time to allow new forms of both personal air transport_ as well as also delivery of supply and materials. A third trend is the advancement of artificial intelligence and data handling systems that may be able to not only allow new types of vehicle operations, but also an ability to handle information in a more complex and situationally appropriate manner. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem?. 
The overall impact varies depending on the type of transport. Related to emergency transport and care, the population may be limited and more concentrated in rural areas. However other forms of medical transport are much more common. For example, professional transport a patient from one health care facility to another is a relatively common occurrence within parameters dictated by legal and health insurance regulations. Further, if air transportation and medical supplies using, for example, autonomous or automated drones becomes a common occurrence, then the impact on the overall health care system on the performance of these technologies can be significant and broad based.

What is the problem or need?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances generate an environment of ubiquitous monitoring both on a personal and societal level. 
Personal health monitoring: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level. Privacy concerns arise related to use of personal information
Wearables hacking - how can we trust the data and protect the users?
There are also remote medical sensing technologies that could be as ubiquitous as CCTV, and even drone-mounted.
NASA's Aeronautics technologies can enable persistent, wide-area coverage of climate-related parameters and NASA's Earth observing satellites add to the data gathering.
Such sensing capabilities enable new opportunities to provide actionable information, detect problems and improve life, while at the same time imply severe ethical issues if misused.

Improved sensing capabilities in & above the water / ice caps.
Implementation of Big Data management of the ubiquitous sensing networks in an equitable manner resulting in high quality results.
What trends are driving this capability or need that may influence the problem or solution space?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances that allow ubiquitous monitoring, combined with Big Data processing and communications, means that the infrastructure structure for Ubiquitous Sensing both on a personal and societal level already exists.
Economic drivers are moving towards use of monitoring technologies to drive specific outcomes, not necessarily for the benefit of the population.
Privacy concerns are declining among younger generations: decline in need for privacy with respect to certain areas of life may allow wearables to be used to communicate more broadly as part of IoT using cloud
TinyML may enable wearables to be powerful computers, recommendation engines
Broad sensing system capabilities are both becoming more pervasive and more easily implemented enabling a new level of monitoring and surveillance.

Scenario - Is there a simple scenario or narrative that can better explain this problem?  This is helpful for downstream readers who will not have the benefit of fully engaging the source material.
<Scenario>
(gpt-4) 
In the not-so-distant future, we find a world grappling with the consequences of climate change, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), and the increasing capabilities of surveillance technology. These global challenges and opportunities touch everyone, yet they disproportionately impact communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which often bear the brunt of climate change effects and are least equipped to adapt to or influence AI and surveillance technologies.

Imagine a coastal community in one such LMIC. The rising sea levels, a direct consequence of climate change, threaten their homes and livelihoods. However, their voices are often unheard in international climate policy discussions. Their limited resources and access to technology make it hard for them to adapt to these changes or participate in mitigation efforts.

Meanwhile, the world around them is becoming increasingly digital. AI systems are transforming economies, Surveillance technologies are becoming ubiquitous, and wearable devices that could help detect and warn of disasters are out of their reach due to economic constraints. These communities are at risk of being left behind or, worse, exploited as the world around them transforms.

This scenario is not just a possibility but a reality for many communities around the world today. The ethical impact of these changes is significant and global, affecting billions of people. The aviation industry is uniquely positioned to influence these challenges, from contributing to climate change mitigation to leveraging AI for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.

However, there are significant gaps in understanding and addressing these problems. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of AI and surveillance technologies are equitably distributed and do not infringe on human rights. We also need to involve the most affected communities in climate change solutions and ensure their voices are heard.

The potential impacts of these issues are well known, but the specific outcomes and how they will evolve are uncertain. As we navigate this future, we must be proactive in addressing these ethical considerations and strive for a world that is not only technologically advanced but also equitable and inclusive.",

AirMed,CAS X1,Medium,"Over 75% of all Medicare Air Transports are in rural communities but patients can wait sometimes days for interfacility transfer and transportation. Transient healthcare specialists in urban centers routinely spend more than 4 hours of ""windshield"" time getting to rural areas to see patients. In X1, AirMed is exploring how aviation can improve patient and provider transportation in rural areas. We are hoping to collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders from Tribal Nations, Pueblos, and municipalities in NW and central New Mexico. Possible solutions currently being explored with stakeholders include:
Integrated Smart System for Patient Transfer and Transportation
AAM Vehicle Design to Support Medical Needs
Remote Monitoring & Diagnostic Assessment of Patients
Preparation for and Application of AAM in NW New Mexico

Aerial AID,CAS X1,High,"Emergency medical responders are overburdened and lack situational awareness of medical scenes. Scene descriptions are limited and often reduced to a “game of telephone” between the caller, the dispatcher, and the response personnel. ​Develop nominal data set and corresponding perception engine for medical UAS use-cases, informed by government and industry partners​

Develop framework for state-of-the-art perception capabilities to be successfully applied to emergency medical UAS use-cases, including transfer learning to enhance state of the art object detection tools​

Integrate cutting-edge assurance research into framework for edge case detection and runtime monitoring​

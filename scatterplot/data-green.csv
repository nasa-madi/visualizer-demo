How might we harvest energy and shield against radiation with melanin?,CAS,Wicked Wild,,Medium,,"Commercial aircraft use about 100 MW of electricity. All that electricity must be generated by the aircraft. This require converting fuel to electricity that results in a reduction of aircraft efficiency. If some portion of that energy could be harvested without the expenditure of fuel that would increase aircraft efficiency. Aircraft operate at high altitudes where UV radiation and cosmic radiation levels are much greater than at ground level. This radiation represents a source of energy that remains unharvested. This free energy could be used to increase the energy efficiency of aircraft while reducing passenger exposure to harmful radiationMelanin is known mostly as a pigment but is a multifunctional material that accels at adsorbing UV and cosmic radiation that make it ideal for energy harvesting applications.  Melanin panels could harvest energy to supplement power. ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:Investigate the ability of natural and synthetic melanin’s to adsorb energy and produce electricity  for aerospace applications.",,"bioinspired melanin based energy harvesting pitch. The basic premise behind this proposal is that commercial aircraft are huge consumers of electricity and every single water that electricity has to be generated by the aircraft itself.
And we know that, you know, whenever we take something like jet fuel and convert it to some other form of energy, like electricity, it's not perfect. There it's, you know, there are losses involved and that comes at the expense of efficiency to the aircraft.
So is there, you know, some way where we could possibly augment or supplement the energy that is around the aircraft and possibly generate some electricity to help these aircraft become more fuel efficient? Now, one of the things is is that because commercial aircraft, you know, they typically fly at very high altitudes and in clear Sky early because they're they're up above the clouds.
The UV radiation at altitude is about 100% greater than what we experience here at ground level.
And cosmic radiation is continuously bombarding earth with about 1 giga electron volts or with energies of about 1 gig electron volts at the rate of about 10,000 per square meter every 2nd. And this happens day and night. So even aircraft flying night time routes or even in cloud clouds, you know, and it's not reliant strictly on on solar energy, but in cosmic energy is is Sir no. So if some portion of that energy, which right now just hits an aircraft and and goes unused, it some part of that could be harvested and converted into electrical energy that could be put back into the aircraft, that would help aircraft. Ohh efficiency. And so you know, how could that be accomplished? Well, you know, the whole idea of energy harvesting isn't new. You know, we have plenty of examples of that currently on Earth, you know, from hydroelectric dams, wind farm, solar farms. All of those take existing energy and harvest it and convert it into electrical energy. One of the things that is our our materials that has been under the radar but is extremely common is melanin. 
Melanin is simply known, or or mostly known, just as a dark brown or a black pigment, and you know helps give us our skin color and and protect us from sunburn. However, that's not really doing melon and much justice. It really is a biopolymer that is amazingly multifunctional. Uh, and it's a macromolecular material, which is a mouthful to say that excels at transforming uh energy, particularly energy from the electromagnetic spectrum, from an A broad portion of that, all the way from like, near infrared to real short wavelength energy like UV and cosmic energy into electricity. Well and and it and it does it through a two stage process. First, it converts it uh into heat, which is exactly why when we go out into the sunlight and and sunlight feels warm, the melanin in our skin is immediately absorbing that energy, converting it to heat, and then it eventually converts it to electricity. So the idea of this is that melanin it's ideally suited for energy harvesting applications, so if we could, you know, and as I show in a in the PowerPoint here, you know if we could coat the top surface or or part of a fuselage with basically melanin based energy harvesting panels and and convert that energy that impacts on those surfaces kind of like a solar cell for an airplane or a type of thing, then it could go into the electrical system of the aircraft and basically you know we know that you know in commercial aircraft you.
Know cost of operation and efficiency you know is is tremendous and so. You know the operators of commercial aircraft are looking for, you know, even fractional increases in efficiency. Uh to help generate and and maintain profitability as. So the wicket idea is to basically investigate a proof of concept melanin based energy absorber to produce electricity. The beauty of this concept is it's simplicity in which this can idea can be investigated. At this low TRL level, synthetic and organic melanin are commercially available through readily available sources. You could coat a substrate with a thin film of melanin and expose it to UV light, and then monitor that sample for the generation of electrical signal. Demonstrating some basic proof of concept that would set the stage for more formal research and development of melon and based energy absorbers for aeronautic applications."
How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,CAS,Wicked Wild,,High,,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation. 
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: Develop HT-PEM technology for aviation
Using HT-PEM fuel cells to power electric aircraft eliminates CO2 emissions while sustaining timely, long-distance travel capability. 
Develop HT-PEM fuel cell materials specifically for aviation 
Focus on membranes, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA)
Include other stack components as opportunities allow
Test HT-PEM fuel cell materials, single cells, and cell stacks under aviation load profiles (high-power flight condition for take off and climb, low ambient air temperature and very dry air at high elevation, etc.)
Demonstrate HT-PEM FC energy efficiency and CO2 emission reductions",,"the pitch is high temperature PEM Fuel cell for aviation.
Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.
It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.
it is the importance into the air and contributing to global warming, the high energy efficiency of fuel may offset the lower energy density of hydrogen.
Therefore comparable few compare size of fuel tank can be used for similar flying distance of country airplane. You're placing.
Engine with a highly efficient fuel cell is a great option.
It means the size of fuel tank and the frying range of current airplane and also completely eliminated the imaging their causes, global warming and protect air. The Department of Energy is developing high temperature paint fusia for ground transportation, especially for heavy duty vehicle.
The pitch this piece is for developing the similar technology for aviation.
The developments are where you focus on material specific for aviation application, such as membranes, electrodes, membrane electrode assembly and other stack components to measure the progress of this activity.
High temperature pain, fuel cell stacks and system will be tested under the aviation load profile. The result will be used to modify and optimize fuel cell system for aviation application.
The results are important for the design of future policy system for electrified, electrified airplane."
"Hydrogen Fuel Aerogel Storage Tanks (HyFAST)",CAS,Wicked Wild,,High,,"Current challenges to (zero carbon) Hydrogen Aircraft fuel storage development often becomes a materials science/engineering issue. Hydrogen poses challenges related to material compatibility, as it can cause hydrogen embrittlement in certain metals used for cryotanks. This can impact the structural integrity of components over time, necessitating the development of materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. Also, hydrogen is highly flammable, and safety is a paramount concern, especially in the aviation industry. In addition to these materials issues, hydrogen storage also creates a challenge for volume occupation and transport safety.
What if…we could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by
 improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety, and efficiency using lightweight polymer aerogels
Utilize porous polymer aerogels as a host system for safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage
Incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage tanks for structural enhancement, vibration damping, and fire retardancy
",,"So with this concept, we were looking at a greener, cleaner, more sustainable environment and a lot of times that equates to lowering carbon emissions. And one of the biggest focuses for lowering carbon emissions would be alternative fuels, and hydrogen has gotten.
It's a tremendous amount of attention throughout arrow and commercial industries, and so some of the current challenges to using 0 carbon hydrogen are it's fuel storage capabilities. And so the development often becomes a material science and engineering issue, and having a background in polymer science, I I believe that this could be maybe remedied through some kind of material capable compatibility. Currently, when you're using hydrogen, because of the pressures and temperatures that you have to keep it at, you can often cause embrittlement in certain materials, especially metals that they're currently using for cryo tanks.
So obviously this impacts the structural integrity of the components over time and now you need a you need materials that can withstand prolonged exposure to hydrogen. In addition, some of the other issues with hydrogen high flammability, which is obviously creates a safety concern and also the storage because of the volume occupation. That's necessary pressures and and and everything that involves keeping hydrogen in its liquid form in order for transport.
This created transport safety issue. So what if you could accelerate beyond hydrocarbon fuels by improving hydrogen fuel storage, aircraft safety and efficiency, and to remedy to be a partial remedy for some of these problems that are obvious in in aeronautics, we suggest using lightweight polymer aerogels for storage.

Now one of the biggest reasons why is because if you utilize a porous polymer in especially a porous polymer aerogel as a host system for liquid hydrogen, you create a safer, more efficient hydrogen fuel storage. And also you can incorporate aerogels into the construction of external hydrogen storage storage tanks, which is a big focus for NASA. And you can create a higher structural integrity and enhanced vibration damping and also incorporate certain polymers for fire retardant seem. what you're looking at now is the potential for some multifunction material like aerogels that not only addresses thermal resistance and and chemical capability, but it could offer energy absorption, vibration damping and lightweight structural reinforcement. And especially with external fuel storage and tanks or pads, this can help remedy the volume requirements for storage, especially with transport which is which is an issue, the polymer aerogels just to quickly let you know if if you're that person out there that doesn't know what ardella is, it's a it's a 3 dimensional structure comprised of a network of of self assembled polymer, which results in a very high porosity which we target over 95% large internal surface areas.  it's a nanoscale pore size, which anywhere from 10 to 20 nanometers the actual the picture, which with the fuel tank is the background is an actual error. low density, low thermal conductivity and excellent wedding and storage capabilities and just very quickly.
You can see that it pairs well with liquid propellants that have with these chemically and thermally resistant polymers. The high porosity and nanoscale pore sizes give the advantage of housing a liquid propellant in a way that it can encase it so that it actually appears as a handles like a solid. So no slashing and low boil off, and again the structural integrity of the error gels which we see over 200 megapascal compressive modulus within the external storage tanks can reduce the overall weight and also improve efficiency and safety while expanding volume capability and the range limits of the craft."
How might we cool next gen aircraft?,CAS,Wicked Wild,,High,,"Opportunity:Sustainable aviation is a key initiative for NASA and the world to address climate change and protect the environment. An opportunity is presented to leverage inherent thermal generation in aircraft operation, typically seen as waste, to support electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation.
Key Use Cases: Assist with thermal management, structural health monitoring, lighting systems, and de-icing.
Possible Partnerships: Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Joby, FAA, and more.  ""Wicked-Wild"" Idea:

Energy harvesting technologies and advanced materials are available, along with an opportunity to drive change in advanced air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion.
",,"I'm talking about heat generation. That's inherent to any process, and specifically in this context, the excess heat generated throughout an aircraft as NASA and countries around the globe look to sustainable aviation to address greener climate and environmental initiatives, we can also shift our perspective on heat generated by engines, batteries and other aircraft components from being a detriment or a flaw to the generated heat being designed feature. Here we have an opportunity to employ energy harvesting as part of an integrated multifunctional system to support our electrification efforts and power the next generation of sustainable aviation, as well as moving a few degrees closer to closing the loop on sustainability. With that, we can address the desirability, viability and feasibility of taking on this opportunity.
As for the desirability, or do they want this energy conversion technology, this technologies as a part of an integrated aircraft system is not a new concept. NASA and companies like Boeing have previously demonstrated interest in the area at the bottom right, doctor Arun Malay of Boeing laid out an aircraft system map to demonstrate the potential of a thermal management system to capture and utilize generated heat, and even now with the the electrification, the aviation batteries introduced a significant source of thermal energy. That one harvested could support secondary systems while simultaneously mitigating and preventing thermal runaway and catastrophic damage. Supported systems could further include comprehensive structural health monitoring, lighting and deicing.
And this all contributes towards energy harvesting, enabling extended operations, reduce costs, reduce strain on systems, providing redundancy and complementing ongoing sustainability efforts. As for viability, or should we do this leveraging integrated energy harvesting? Harvesting systems will support aircraft functions, optimize operational and energy efficiency through integrated systems, improve safety and reduce waste, has for feasibility. Or can we do this? The technologies in advanced materials are available along with an opportunity to drive change in advance air mobility and electrified aircraft propulsion. While they're still in the early stages of development, so with that, though wicked wild idea proposed here is a world where aircraft are multifunctional, fully integrated closed loop systems possibly. Imagine the nervous system of a body completely connected and optimized to regulate temperature and subsystem functions and aviation wasted energy from thermal motion and other energy sources will be harvested for secondary functions to enhance electrification and sustainability initiatives. Demonstrate integrated thermal management systems and enable comprehensive structural health management and we here at NASA have the multidisciplinary expertise needed to solve this challenge and make an impactful change to the state of green aviation.

How might we improve temperature monitoring for electrified vehicles using Optical Fiber?,CAS,Wicked Wild,,Super High,,"Electrified Air Mobility Vehicles can reduce carbon emission currently facing aerospace industry
Currently Air transportation is around 2% of overall carbon emission
But since vehicle emit carbon high in the sky, it’s causing 5% of global warming effect
Two types of electrify vehicle – both has a temperature issue
Battery-Electric vehicle – traditional battery utilizing Li-Ion based chemistry, where precise battery health (via temperature monitoring) is critical to the vehicle.
Hydrogen Fuel-Cell Vehicle – By converting on-board hydrogen fuel into electricity via fuel-cell technology, the power-density of such vehicle is greater than battery-electric vehicle
Temperature distribution across the fuel cell is critical for vehicle health
Temperature monitoring across LH2 fuel line to ensure no leakage

Optical Fiber for electric-vehicle temperature sensing
Completely Optical – Won’t cause or affected by EMI
High Spatial Density – multiple sensors cascaded onto one fiber for FEM level temperature gradient monitoring",,"Today I want to propose the idea of using optical fiber for temperature sensing for electric 5 vehicles. Right now I wanna paint the point that air transportation is is a significant amount of carbon emission for for the aerospace industry and aerospace for for aeronautics. Basically, they want to reduce the carbon emission and one of the great ways of doing this is electric file. The aircraft vehicle.
Uh, but, but in order to do that, transition that into electrified vehicle, there is a lot of obstacles. First of all, the if you are doing a short term, kind of like a short range flight, you're looking at a battery. Electric vehicles, which are traditional using a lithium ion battery chemistry, but then these are different than electrical vehicles. When when you have a a runaway, then on lithium ion battery you can just pull over and get out of the car. But if you are on the middle of a flight, that's that's really not ideal. So so you would want to have a a system to monitor whenever you have a better resell that is not performing well with elevated temperatures you you can have active way to monitoring and now go into the other way if you want to do a long term long haul transportation. One of the ways that that a lot of aerospace company i.e.
Airbuses is is working on is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle where you use hydrogen as a fuel source and then you use the fuel cell in order to to sustain the the airplane for for long haul transportation.
Now you now you have a new type of fuel with hydrogen.
You have to liquefy the hydrogen and you would need some sort of way to have the high spatial density in order to measure the the the the temperature level across the liquid hydrogen and then the the the fuel line of the liquid hydrogen. So so for the future aircraft, we could now you you want to get to a way to to monitor temperature. So the pitch that I wanna make is we already have fiber optic sensing technology that has a high spatial density and good thing about the fiber is completely optical.
It won't cause or affect by electromagnetic interference that that the X57 team at Armstrong has been experiencing and just the proposal.
Now you can use these optical fiber to integrate it into your high current wire that gave a lot of heat. So you you can use it to monitor battery.
You can use it to monitor the wires that you have on to your airplane. So so that you have proof of confidence that you won't have a runaway effect and you would have a new paradigm shift in sensing suite that you instead of doing like a specific discrete point onto some layers of your wire.
Now you have you you have a temperature distribution every half inch interval across your your airplane."

Battery Pack Modelling,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Battery Pack Modelling Proposal Electro-Chemical & Structural-Thermal pack modelling proposal for TTT / Green Aviation Call, 2023 1) Problem, Objectives, Approach, and Anticipated Benefits: Many of novel aircraft concepts include some degree of electrification to reduce carbon footprint. To date, the battery models that have been able to be incorporated into NASA aircraft preliminary design studies such as the quadrotor0F 1 have been cell-level models1F 2, with knockdown factors for pack-level effects. There is an interest from EPFD, TTT, AATT, and other projects, in being able to more accurately model and optimize pack-level structural and thermal effects in addition to the cell-level effects. However, to date, there was no clear path on how this could be accomplished while still being compatible with cutting edge gradient-based aircraft optimization tools like OpenMDAO2F 3 and Aviary3F 4. The objective of this research proposal is to create an open-source battery pack model that includes cell electro-chemical effects as well as pack-level structural-thermal effects. The resulting model will be differentiable to ensure compatibility with OpenMDAO and Aviary. Our approach is to create a multi-center team and use open-source tools that we are already familiar with to create a system-level battery pack design. Figure 1 shows an Extended Design Structure Matrix (XDSM) diagram that details of how each of the component disciplines fits together to make the overall battery-pack model. In Figure 1, Discharge curves from cell-tests are input into the cell electro-chemical model which allows for the configuration of the parameters of the cell and later analysis. The cell electro-chemical effects based on models from ProgPy4F 5. A CAD model of the pack (multiple cells) is then created and imported along with the number of packs into the structural-thermal model TACS5F 6. The TACS software performs structural analysis to evaluate the mass of the pack as well as configure parameters for use later in the analysis. At this point the battery pack will be run through a sample mission which will primarily consist of pulling a specified quantity of amps at a particular voltage from the system over a given amount of time. During the mission, the cell electro-chemical model will keep track of the state of charge and voltage of the cells. TACS will keep track of the temperature throughout the pack subject to the heat produced by each cell and a assuming a constant cooling flow.

Effects of Atmospheric Conditions and Sustainable Fuels on Contrail Radiative Forcing,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Executive summary
Contrails create about two-thirds of aviation’s contribution to climate change. To guarantee the success
of contrail mitigation strategies such as flight altitude changes, the sensitivity of contrail optical depth to

"Improved Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) Simulations for Design, Analysis and Optimization of Both Airframe and Propulsor",TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Improved Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) Simulations for Design, Analysis and Optimization of Both Airframe and Propulsor 

Propulsion Airframe Integration (PAI) at NASA is inadequate for addressing subsonic transport Mach numbers and higher, as well as distortion for blades with a lot of twist consistent of typical high bypass ratio turbofans for relatively quick design-study or optimization types of runs.  PAI capability for design understanding is critical for getting improved performance of aircraft and to meet key sustainability goals of NASA. The current codes have actuator disk capability for steady simulations which are inadequate or have the ability to run time accurate with rotating blades installed but require thousands of CPUs and thousands of CPU/GPU hours to run.   

The Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD), a TTBW configuration is designated as the X-66A as shown on the left of Figure 1.  It consists of a Pratt and Whitney Geared Turbofan.  That configuration can be simulated under existing cruise conditions using existing NASA CFD tools where the propulsor can be modeled as either an actuator disk or with appropriate boundary condition at the Nacelle inlet and exhausts.  Crosswind configurations or very high angles of attack will be more difficult or not possible with those same tools.  On the right of Figure 1 is the Open Fan concept engine that GE is currently developing in their partnership with CFM International.  Having this architecture engine on the TTBW and simulating with existing NASA tools would not produce an accurate description of the interaction unless one spent months getting one unsteady result.  This capability is not only lacking at NASA, but in the industry as well.  Improved PAI simulation capability that can be done relatively quickly can allow for reduced fuel burn through modifications of the propulsor and airframe at the same time.

Technical and economic trade study on using Photo-and-Photovoltaic-Batteries in Tandem with conventional or novel LH2 for long-haul (inter-continental) flights.,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Technical and economic trade study on using Photo-and-Photovoltaic-Batteries in
Tandem with conventional or novel LH2 for long-haul (inter-continental) flights.
Green aviation faces multiple challenges (technical, processing, resources, and economic). To realize this
vision, the aviation industry needs to solve various parts (energy storage, propulsion, supply chain,
recyclability, and safety) of the puzzle. Short-haul flights could be solved using battery technology alone,
it is unlikely that long-haul or intercontinental flights would be able to run on battery technology in the
foreseeable future. There are a few alternative ideas proposed in the literature such as sustainable aviation
fuel (SAF), hydrogen propulsion, fuel cells, and hybrid electric vehicles, however, each of these faces its
own technical, economic, and climate challenges.
Any hybrid solution will require a separate battery to store energy, in addition to any backup or auxiliary
systems. In such cases, the battery will occupy precious volume and mass in an aircraft. In addition, these
batteries will need to be quickly recharged at an airport since other fuels require less turnaround time. This
leads to two possible solutions, either fast charging at the destination or charging during the cruise portion
of the flight (which is also the low-power portion of the flight). One possible solution is a photon or a
photovoltaic battery, such a combined solution could reduce weight, use amble solar energy above the cloud
cover, and charge the battery during flight. Note that NASA has envisioned solar cell-driven aircraft with
Helios and Pathfinder in the past, but these efforts were limited to unmanned aircraft. Thus, some of the
techniques and technologies can be leveraged. One of the major shortcomings of a solar cell (apart from
low efficiency) is that it must be connected to a battery or other energy storage device, or a micro-grid to
store/distribute the electricity it generates.
For this project, we propose a high-level techno-eco-sustainability study to investigate the potential benefit
of combining energy storage and photovoltaics into a single integrated solution. However, a combination
of these technologies is in a nascent stage with some explored integration ideas [1], choosing a
photosensitive material as an electrode or putting a PV or a battery as an integrated package (Fig. 1), for
combining photovoltaics with batteries. One of the challenges is that the efficiency of a combined system
is about 10%, significantly lower than a single junction (about 20% [2]), as well as current state-of-the-art
multi-junction devices (the maximum efficiency is greater than 45%). Another approach that is being
developed is to use persistent phosphor for ""Photon Energy-Storage"". Here the photon energy is thermal
energy, which can be converted through an electrochemical or a photovoltaic route.
Figure 1: Different photo-charging techniques: a) closed system, b) integrated solution.
The research in developing a technology can be significant and it is often necessary to develop trade-offs
to venture into a new technology that is still nascent. Here we propose to perform a techno-economicenvironmental impact to understand the practicality of pursuing improving either technology while,
performing the life-cycle-assessment of materials used in the technology and its environmental impact
during the materials life-process (extraction, processing, reuse capability).
Developing a trade study from a material, technology, recyclable, integration, supply chain, and greenness
in addition to the viability of a novel technology can provide a good decision tool for new technologies.
For this study, we will investigate the viability of photon-thermal/electrochemical energy conversion and
storage for electric aviation.
The work will focus on three aspects: 1) Safety, a combination of volatile electrolytes, and low
melting point materials with photovoltaics could generate heat that could be catastrophic. A simple
thermal analysis will be performed to identify safety risks; 2) techno-economic-recyclability, using
the Circular Economy Modeling and Analysis tool [3] from NREL will be used to perform
technical, economic, and recyclability of technology and supply chains. Lastly, Environmental
Sustainability: A comparative LCA with a cradle-to-gate approach will be performed using
NREL’s GREET (The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies

Photovoltaics for Energy Augmentation of Electric Aircraft,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,," Title: Photovoltaics for Energy Augmentation of Electric Aircraft 
Climate change is the greatest threat to humanity.  We are in a race to develop solutions that maintain and improve quality of life without intensifying causes of climate change.  The development of electrified aircraft allows humanity to maintain civilization with less carbon emissions. One challenge to electrification of aircraft is the mass of batteries required to sustain flight significantly limits the aircraft payload and flight duration.  We propose the inclusion of high voltage, thin film, perovskite based solar arrays laminated onto the aircraft wings and fuselage in production. The integration of these solar cells offset power density needs for batteries for electrified aircraft reducing weight. When coupled with a fuselage manufactured from light weight next generation materials.  
Outfitting an electric airplane with perovskite solar cells would offset power density needs for the Lithium ion batteries, reducing weight.  If we assume a 737 airplane traveling from NYC to LA on a sunny day, with modest 20% efficient perovskite solar cells integrated, the solar cells would generate 320 kWhr of energy on that flight. This is achieved with just 1.2 kg of perovskite solar cells total mass over the plane. That energy allows a mass reduction of 1200 kg of lithium ion batteries. These ultralight weight solar cells save 1200 kg of battery mass. Perovskites are especially propitious for photovoltaic application due to their exceptional properties, such as large-charge carrier diffusion lengths [1], long carrier lifetimes, strong optical absorption [2], weak exciton binding [3], and favorable band gaps [2]. Perovskite based photovoltaics are thin films (300-500 nm) light weight, low cost, and are compatible with solution or vapor phase processing techniques. Multi-junction (tandem) solar cells consisting of multiple light absorbers with considerably different bandgaps show great potential in breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of a single junction solar cell (33%) by absorbing light in a broader range of wavelengths.[4] These tandem solar cells are expected to achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 25.2% (with theoretical limits of 42%) and are 500X thinner than the current state of the art (SOA) technology.  Perovskite solar cells also absorb light more strongly than SOA GaAs solar cells. 
My previous research has led to the development of single junction perovskite solar cell at reproducible 20% power conversion efficiency that can withstand the harsh low earth environment and are stable to terrestrial stressors. We can apply lessons learned from that effort to develop a lightweight low-cost perovskite based tandem photovoltaic capable of greater power output. We will select materials suitable for the wide bandgap (1.7-1.9 eV) second junction solar cell and we will demonstrate the ability to fabricate these cells, regardless of solvent compatibility, with a lamination technique that has been demonstrated to be effective with perovskite interlayers.[5]  
Electrified aircraft is a newer venture with the first passenger electric aircraft, Alice, flight in September 2022.  Long duration unmanned air vehicles augmented with photovoltaics like the AeroVironment Helios vehicle have demonstrated feasibility of solar and fuel cell powered aerial vehicles.  These vehicles have currently been limited to small payload vehicles as mass is limited.  Emerging photovoltaic technologies, like those based on perovskites, allow for previously unachievable specific powers (W/kg).  When compared to the state of the art III-V or Silicon solar cells, perovskites

Hydrogen Powered Aviation Through Sustainable Manufacturing and Repair of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic Composite Cryotanks.,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Hydrogen Powered Aviation Through Sustainable Manufacturing and Repair of Carbon Fiber
Reinforced Thermoplastic Composite Cryotanks.
The current use of fossil fuels within the aviation industry contributes more to global warming than is generally appreciated because of the mix of climate
pollutants it generates. A recent model analyzed the CO2 and non-CO2 effects (like nitrogen oxide
emissions and contrail formation) to assess aviation's total warming footprint. The report found aviation
contributed approximately 4% to observed human-induced global warming to date, despite being
responsible for only 2.4% of global annual emissions of CO2.(1)
One solution to the continued impact of aviation on climate change is a shift toward Sustainable
Aviation Fuels (SAFs), such as hydrogen. The European Clean Aviation Initiative reports that hydrogen
power can be part of the green aviation solution in that hydrogen power completely eliminates
CO2 emissions and can be produced carbon-free. Considering non-CO2 emissions as well, the latest
estimates show that hydrogen combustion could reduce the climate impact of flight by up to 75%, and
fuel-cell propulsion by up to 90%.(2) The Clean Sky 2 Program, which is part of the Clean Aviation
Initiative found that hydrogen either for fuel cells, direct burn in gas turbine engines or as a building
block for synthetic liquid fuels could feasibly power aircraft with entry into service by 2035 for shortrange aircraft at a cost of less than $20 extra per person on a short-range flight, and reducing climate
impact by 50 to 90%. (3)
Problem: While a clear pay-off exists for hydrogen powered aircraft, the physical space required to carry
gaseous hydrogen is large, requiring cryogenic storage hydrogen fuel as a liquid, at -253oC. The
successful utilization of lightweight carbon fiber/polymer composite tanks has met challenges cycling to
this temperature, the primary challenge being microcracking of the matrix.
Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Composite cryotanks have been evaluated by industry
and Government for decades.(4) The most common materials and manufacturing approach for
composite tanks has been autoclave consolidated carbon fiber and epoxy composite. As the tank is
subjected to repeated fill/drain cycles, the mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion between
the carbon fiber reinforcement and epoxy matrix leads to residual stresses in the laminated tank wall
resulting in matrix microcracking (5). This was addressed by the NASA Composite Cryotank Technology
Demonstration Project in 2013 by using thin plies to reduce interlaminar stresses. This approach was
successful in reducing, but not eliminating microcracking. Once microcracking starts, it cannot be
repaired in an epoxy matrix cryotank. In addition, the epoxy matrix material is cured in an autoclave
which is a high energy process and requires the use of non-recyclable/ non-reusable consumable
materials.
A separate materials option for composite cryotanks is carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics.
Thermoplastic matrix composites offer greater compliance than the traditional epoxy (thermoset)
matrix materials and therefore the potential to reduce matrix microcracking. There has been limited
research using thermoplastics due to manufacturing challenges such as low drapability of the composite
prepreg and the requirement for high processing temperatures. Recent developments in low melt
temperature materials and automated manufacturing provide new opportunities for this material class.
Thermoplastic composites are receiving attention for cryogen storage, most notably a study is currently
underway in the Netherlands to build and evaluate thermoset and thermoplastics composites for liquid
hydrogen cryotanks for commercial aircraft. (6)

Robust Repair and Refurbishment Technologies Enabling Reusability and Life Extension of Ceramic Matrix Composites Propulsion Components,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title:  Robust Repair and Refurbishment Technologies Enabling Reusability and Life Extension of Ceramic Matrix Composites Propulsion Components  

Advanced silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix (SiC/SiC) composite components are currently in service and being further developed for insertion in several turbine engine applications. The advantages of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) over metals include lower weight, higher temperature capability and stability, and corrosion resistance while the advantages over monolithic (non-fiber reinforced) ceramics include damage tolerance, graceful failure, and thermal shock resistance. CMC turbine engine components offer significant performance benefits of reduced cooling, fuel burn, and emissions (NOx and COx), however, the materials are relatively expensive with complex manufacturing required for the integrated constituents of the CMC. During service, the CMC components (e.g. turbine blades, vanes, shrouds, and combustor liners) experience degradation in performance due to various forms of damage including oxidation, impact damage, erosion, surface spallation, and delamination. Currently, as CMC parts wear out and, in some cases, when cooling channels within CMCs are degraded or clogged, they need to be replaced with brand new parts. The continuous replacement of CMC components will be quite expensive given the high acquisition cost of components. It will also contribute to material waste and a higher demand for labor, time, and energy resources during their fabrication compared to that of refurbished parts.  

Currently, metallic turbine engine components are regularly repaired and refurbished during engine overhauls to extend life of components. This repair and refurbishment provide significant cost savings, extends reliability, safety, and life of components as well as reduce wastes. However, looking at the ceramic matrix composite landscape, no viable repair or refurbishment technology is available. At GRC, we have significant experience in developing repair and refurbishment technologies for space shuttle leading edges (C/C composites) and a collaborative program with Goodrich Corp. for the C/C composite aircraft brake repair and refurbishment.  These technologies were developed at high TRL level and wide variety of testing was conducted.  

We propose to advance the state-of-the-art by developing methods to repair and refurbish SiC/SiC CMCs to retain material performance requirements and extend their service life thus reducing waste. As of now, there are no suitable methods to extend the life of damaged CMCs using repair and refurbishment technologies. One method investigated by other researchers is the self-healing of cracked CMCs by forming glasses in the matrix or coating which melt and flow to fill in cracks (ref. 1-2). However, the formed glass can only slowdown the oxidation in the vicinity of a matrix crack without contributing to CMC mechanical load carrying capability. Also, low melting glasses are not appropriate as they create stress corrosion, vaporization, and reduce service life. Currently used CMCs do not have any glass forming constituents due to these reasons. Any repair and refurbishment technology should not only be able to repair only cracks but other forms of CMC damage such as cooling channels restoration. It should also avoid potential chemical incompatibility with the CMCs and/or their environmental barrier coatings (EBCs). Furthermore, the self-healing crack methods have temperature capabilities well below the SiC/SiC maximum service temperature of 2400°F and especially the new target of 2700°F for next generation SiC/SiC. A group from Boeing has investigated patches for repairing space shuttle leading edges (ref. 3). Their approach does not seem to have been fully developed or reported. The leading-edge patches are not fully processed until earth-atmosphere-reentry heating where the high reentry temperatures act to pyrolyze the material. At NASA GRC, Dr. Mrityunjay Singh, who is part of this proposal, had developed “Glenn Refractory Adhesive for Bonding and Exterior Repair (GRABER) (refs. 4-8)”, which was successfully used for repairing reinforced carbon/carbon composite (RCC) with different types of damage (cracks, spallation, delamination, etc). The verification and qualification testing was carried out in arc-jet testing facilities at NASA JSC, NASA Ames, and Boeing LCAT facilities in St. Louis, MO. He has also worked with largest US aircraft brake manufacturer for the repair and refurbishment of C/C composite aircraft brakes. Experience gained from the assessment of CMC damage and repair techniques will be leveraged for our specific case of SiC/SiC CMCs for turbine engine applications with an emphasis on retaining mechanical properties and environmental stability in a steam environment. Engine combustion environments are rich in water vapor which can cause reactions and surface recession and degradation of SiC/SiC materials.  

The approach is to develop a method for the repair and refurbishment of SiC/SiC CMCs. Material compositions will be developed and evaluated. Processing conditions will be optimized. Various types of flaws (e.g. surface, through holes, and de-laminations) will be introduced into the CMC test specimens. For larger flaws, a preform of SiC woven cloth will be integrated with the repair materials for maintaining CMC structural integrity. The ability for the repair and patch methods to retain mechanical strength and environmental durability will be assessed. Testing of tensile coupons while under a mechanical stress in a steam environment will be conducted to compare the performance of undamaged, damaged & unrepaired, and damaged & repaired CMCs. The results will be analyzed to determine repair effectiveness. Correlations will be made between material microstructures, processing conditions, and properties.  

CMCs enable more efficient turbine engines for reducing fuel consumption, carbon emissions and environmental impacts due to their higher operating temperatures, reduced cooling requirements, and improved engine efficiency. Successful repair methods will further enhance the green technology benefits of CMCs by contributing to their greater utilization in turbine engines, longer component lives, and reduced costs and waste.

Performance Enhancement of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Components with Machine Learning for Electric Aircraft Propulsion,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Performance Enhancement of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Components with Machine Learning for Electric Aircraft Propulsion 

NASA aeronautics goals include pioneering new technology to reduce emissions, noise, and carbon footprint from air travel.  The feasibility of using fuel cells and on-board cryogenic hydrogen (H2) systems in combination with electric motors for zero emission commercial transport aircraft has been widely examined.  Developing a practical, implementable carbon-free electric power system for a highly constrained “electric aircraft” application is a complex and complicated poly-dimensional optimization problem. The primary factor limiting fuel cell implementation remains thermal management at the required high fuel cell stack specific power levels resulting from inadequate heat transfer and unacceptably inefficient operation manifesting as low average cell voltage (Vcc). Despite many historical and current research efforts by government, academia, and aviation industry, the relative importance of design parameters across multiple systems and levels of assembly remains poorly understood.  Materials science and engineering has played a central role in the evolution of improved electrochemical technologies such as fuel cells and batteries. However, traditional ‘‘Edisonian’’ approaches to evolve from discovery to commercial implementation is too costly and time consuming relative to the accelerating anthropogenic climate change resulting from Carbon Cycle disruptions. The emergence of Machine Learning (ML) modeling methods with increasingly powerful computers has augmented cross-disciplinary technological advances from materials discovery to commercialized products.  This activity proposes using the latest artificial intelligence (AI) research to develop two ML models. the first model is critical to understand the relationships among system-level variables for electric aircraft propulsion (EAP) by assessing fuel cell power system response (Vcc) to the normalized aircraft electrical load current density (i) (
 The second model will implement a self-driven approach based on the first model and leverage existing models to elucidate the critical supporting parameters for optimizing the fuel cell system operation and calculate the EAP fuel cell power system performance metrics of power density (W/L), specific power (W/kg) and long-term stability from repeated experimentation.  Establishing a self-driving laboratory for a ML fuel cell technology modeling tool marks a pioneering leap in sustainable energy research which sets it apart from traditional modeling methodologies like Monte Carlo modeling. This information will focus objective development goals by identifying material, components and/or system interfaces that can viably meet EAP performance metrics and provide feasible performance profiles for aircraft-level models investigating EAP. These sensitive parameters potentially can range from fuel cell component materials, mechanisms to enhance convective heat transfer, to low mass phase change materials, to optimizing power management and distribution (PMAD) components for reducing ohmic resistance. The study is a general development of a tool of FC for implementing EAP in the medium-scale commercial aircraft as it provides the most impactful transformation to zero emission commercial aviation.

Maximizing the Efficiency of Advanced Air Mobility with Formation Flight,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Maximizing the Efficiency of Advanced Air Mobility with Formation Flight 

Formation flying is a well-known approach for improving the efficiency of flight. Migratory birds flying in V-formation gain significant efficiency by taking advantage of the upwash from the wing tip of the leading bird, which allows the trailing birds to fly with reduced angle-of-attack and lower induced drag [1]. For birds and aircraft alike, the key to gaining maximum efficiency with this technique is identifying the optimal configuration of the formation. While birds can do this adaptively in actual flight (and millions of years of evolution), computational tools are needed to investigate the possible benefits for safely improving the efficiency of human air transportation especially for use of newly emerging electric-Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicle designs. 

The computational objectives needed for a comprehensive study of formation flight are: 

Finding the optimal formation configuration as function of vehicle types/design and flight conditions, 

Identifying the most efficient (and safe) way to form the configuration, 

and maneuver within the formation, e.g., to transfer the lead-aircraft 

potentially with specialized actuators for control within the wake where traditional actuators (e.g., ailerons) lose effectiveness. 

A study of the control laws to 

automatically hold the optimal configuration, 

while remaining robust to adverse weather disturbances, 

Determining methods to maneuver the overall formation as one,  

and compute optimal trajectories of the formation in weather. 

 

The concept of formation flight is not new and has been studied extensively. Some theoretical studies have shown potential drag reduction for extended formation flight at 38%-45%, and flight tests with more conventional vehicle types (F/A 18 and C-17) at AFRC have shown fuel flow reduction of 7%-18% [2].  Flight dynamics in wake is not necessarily LTI (linear time invariant) but is nonlinear LTV (linear time varying) [3].  The efficiency gains from free lift associated with formation flight may be offset by degradation in stability and control.  Safety and ride quality are important considerations.  The uncertainty around the trade-space for eVTOL vehicles is exactly why this type of work needs to be funded initially at a small funding level.  Because of the nature of the challenges in many different areas (nonlinear aerodynamics, nonlinear LTV flight dynamics, and nonlinear control), this is a rich area for research.  There are computational models for wake interaction currently under development [4] which could be utilized in this study to enable rapid assessment and trade-space exploration. 

There are however few (if any) studies on optimization of formation flight for more efficient Urban Air Mobility operations with eVTOL vehicles. Also, the simultaneous considerations of control robustness and formation safety are missing from all the studies that we know of. Traditionally, flight safety is concerned with wake avoidance, whereas the objective here is to leverage it for energy savings.

Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric Propulsion,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Sensor System Study for Health Management of Sustainable Aviation Based on Electric
Propulsion
 NASA is committed to supporting the U.S. climate goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse
gas emissions from the aviation sector by 2050 and is leading federal agencies and industry to
accelerate the development of sustainable aviation technologies. This includes developing and
deploying alternate, new vehicle designs and architectures including Hybrid Electric or All Electric
vehicle concepts [1,2]. Examples are the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (SUSAN) Electrofan, the Singleaisle Turboelectric AiRCraft with Aft Boundary Layer propulsor (STARC-ABL), and other activities
[3,4,5].
However, these aircraft concepts introduce new hardware systems along with new health
management challenges. For example, fault detection and diagnostics of hybrid electric or all
electric propulsion systems requires an understanding of the operation, performance, degradation,
and failure mechanisms of electric machines, converters (inverters/rectifiers), and power cables
along with the operation of these devices in increasingly complex flight environments [6].
Introduction of new vehicle types and integrated power and propulsion systems requires
increasingly intelligent vehicle systems with capability to detect, diagnose, and predict system
degradation, faults, and failures in a resilient and trustworthy manner. Furthermore, intelligent
vehicle systems must be capable of estimating system capability as it degrades. Monitoring the
system health state has an impact on system operating cost, performance, efficiency, and
environmental impact. Predictive maintenance reduces maintenance cost and vehicle down-time
through reduced unnecessary maintenance costs and improved vehicle availability and throughput.
Efforts are ongoing to evaluate and document potential failure modes and hazards posed by an
Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) system [6]. Due to their increased complexity and integrated
nature, EAP systems present additional failure modes and hazards not found in conventional
aircraft propulsion designs. Mitigation of these EAP failures requires a system-level design and
analysis approach, which is on-going. Major findings of this work include that EAP degradation,
faults, and failure modes present new health management challenges. This requires background
understanding of electrical engineering and system control and concept of operations (motor
control, generator control, battery management systems). Furthermore, electrical systems don’t
always degrade/fail gracefully, which makes early (timely) diagnosis to enable maintenance
challenging.
Faults include those associated with: electric machines (motors/generators) such as the health of
bearings, lubrication and cooling, windings, rotor, insulation; converters (inverters/rectifiers),
electronic components and the cooling system; high voltage wire and cables, including short or
open circuits and insulation breakdown; overall power quality including degradation/faults leading
to voltage ripple and power instabilities; and thermal management system and battery failures
(thermal runaway). These types of faults require new sensor measurement types compared to
turbine engine, e.g., concentrating on current and voltage, and tailored for a new infrastructure
associated with EAP rather than turbine engines. Although these faults are being identified in 
System Analysis and Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FEMCA) studies presently
ongoing in the ARMD [7], there is limited ongoing work related to understanding the sensor types
and sensing approaches most optimized for this new aircraft infrastructure. Such an understanding
is a necessary first step toward Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM), combining sensing,
diagnostics, and prognostics, for future Sustainable Aviation based on EAP.
Objectives: This task will work in parallel with the ongoing analysis of EAP fault detection [6,7] to
examine sensors and sensor systems that can address fault detection in EAP aircraft. The challenges
for sensor technology for EAP applications include: operation in a high noise environment or with
corona discharge at altitude; increasing integration of sensor technology into electric components
to minimize size weight power and cost; multi parameter measurements to better understand the
health state of the EAP system; providing actionable information for higher level diagnostics; and
leveraging the EAP architecture itself to provide better system level diagnostics. This task intends to
formulate a framework for sensor and sensors systems for EAP health management applications
addressing these challenges.
Approach: In particular, this task will examine the EAP architecture and fault studies to first
understand the wide range of potential failure mechanisms. It will then survey the existing methods
of EAP fault detection to both understand how it is done now, and shortfalls to these approaches. It
will then examine methods for improved EAP sensing including, e.g., new sensor types or additive
manufacturing. The conclusion of this work is a white paper summarizing the above activities and a
preliminary road map for possible ARMD future investment in this area.
This task leverages the ongoing activities in the Intelligent Control and Autonomy Branch (LCC) and
related existing expertise and capabilities [7]. Coordination between multiple sensor Subject Matter
Experts (SME) within the Communications and Intelligent Systems Division, as well as SME in other
Branches both at NASA Glenn Research Center and across the agency is planned. At least one trip is
planned given available resources to a relevant conference related to this topic and/or industry to
broaden the input provided to this study.
Although not presently proposed, but could considered with project management, is the possibility
of hosting a Technical Interchange Meeting (TIM) on the topic Sensor Technology for EAP Health
Management, or even more broadly for IVHM for Sustainable EAP Aviation.
Anticipated Benefits: This task performs the initial survey work needed to define a sensor approach
to be combined with both on-going and future ARMD activities in IVHM for EAP applications
program in sensing, diagnostics, and prognostics. IVHM for EAP is necessary for eventual system
application, whether it be for safety, economic, efficiency, or performance reasons. Overall, new
electric vehicles can be smarter, safer, and more efficient leveraging the difference in architecture;
this work is a first step in providing sensor technology to enable this vision.",,

Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title:Modeling and mitigation of hydrogen embrittlement of GRX-810 alloy for hydrogen propulsion storage tanks 

     Cryogenic hydrogen fueled aircraft (under development at NASA GRC, Airbus, etc.) is one of the options to slash CO2 emissions related to air transportation. The main issue with using hydrogen in aircraft is its very low density [1]. Storing hydrogen in its liquid state (at cryogenic temperature) is one of the methods to increase the density. Liquid hydrogen storage tank needs to be resistant to hydrogen embrittlement and capable of structurally withstanding the temperatures of liquid hydrogen. Hydrogen embrittlement is a reduction in the ductility of the structural material (metal alloy) due to absorbed hydrogen. The main goal of this proposal is to investigate the effects of hydrogen absorption on ductility of the alloy GRX-810 [2], that is under development at NASA GRC. GRX-810 is a new breakthrough 3D-printable alloy with remarkable high temperature properties, e.g., creep. It is an oxide dispersion-strengthened alloy with a Ni-Co-Cr matrix. Preliminary tests of this alloy at cryogenic temperatures also show promising results (Yield Strength (YS) T®77K ~ 0.9 GPa, Elongation to Failure (EF), or ductility T®77K ~ 40%). We note that recently developed Ni-Co-Cr-based Medium Entropy Alloys (MEAs) in general demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures, e.g., a remarkable increase in strength accompanied by a simultaneous increase in ductility (YS T®77K ~ 0.7 GPa, EF T®77K ~ 90%, FT T®77K ~ 280 MPa×m1/2), with decreasing deformation temperature from Room Temperature (RT) to cryogenic temperatures [3]. The diffusivity of hydrogen (e.g., along the grain boundaries), its segregation at lattice defects and the corresponding effects on deformation behavior (e.g., ductility) have not been quantified in the literature for Ni-Co-Cr-based MEAs, in general, and GRX-810 alloy, in particular. Atomistic modeling and simulations are perfectly suited to study the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement in full atomic detail and provide recommendations for novel alloy compositions that improve deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures. Our proposed effort will be leveraged by the capabilities we already have. In particular, the Density Functional Theory- (DFT) informed simulation potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group, will be used for this project, along with the state-of-the-art atomistic simulation techniques (including ab-initio, molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo, and their combinations) [4, 5]. 
First, we will fit the interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr-H (using the existent interatomic potential for Ni-Co-Cr, recently developed in our group), to enable realistic modeling of hydrogen diffusion and segregation at lattice defects in the material. Next, the segregation of hydrogen at lattice defects (e.g., grain boundaries) will be investigated, employing hybrid Molecular Dynamics / kinetic Monte Carlo (MD/MC) simulations. And finally, the effects of hydrogen segregation on deformation behavior at cryogenic temperatures will be studied. In particular, a series of MD deformation tests will be carried out at cryogenic temperatures, varying the amount of hydrogen (and the amounts individual Ni, Co, Cr elements) in the simulation system containing a lattice defect, which would serve as a sink for hydrogen (e.g., a grain boundary). The successful accomplishment of the proposed work will lead to identifying the composition that most effectively improves the performance of the material at cryogenic temperatures. ",,
"Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for Aircraft Structures",TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Energy Efficient, Out-of-Autoclave Manufacturing of Thermoplastic Composites for
Aircraft Structures.
Background: Industry enthusiasm around thermoplastic composites (TPCs) is seeing a
resurgence due to the potential for rapid manufacture of large aerospace structures. TPC
matrices differ from the traditionally utilized thermosetting resins in that fabrication of a
thermoplastic (TP) part requires only heating the material above its softening temperature and
applying pressure to consolidate multiple layers of material. Currently, this process requires
consolidation in a press or autoclave. The autoclave process for TPs has a substantial energy
requirement for heating and cooling (processing temperatures are higher for TPs than
thermosets) and autoclave/press consolidation requires non-reusable, consumable materials.
However, opportunity for manufacturing flexibility exists for TPs because the requirement for
consolidating thermoplastics includes only heat and pressure. Of particular interest is out-ofautoclave consolidation.
Problem: Out-of-autoclave or ‘in-situ’ consolidation eliminates the energy intensive
processing step of autoclave or press consolidation. To date, mechanical tests on parts
manufactured by this process have shown a reduction in interlaminar strength. Previous work
at the University of Delaware studied the physical mechanisms controlling laminate quality
during in-situ consolidation by automated fiber placement (AFP). Process variables such as heat
transfer, inter-ply contact time, and void reduction were modeled, tested, and quantified. The
causes of inadequate consolidation were correlated with process, material, and machine
parameters. The study concluded that heat transfer, lay-down speed, and consolidation
pressure were the principle controllable process variables affecting laminate quality. (1,2)
Current AFP and braiding processes do not support the time, temperature or pressure
requirements to allow single-step production of aerospace quality composites.
Has someone tried to solve the problem before. Out-of-autoclave processes have been
attempted and is an area of active research but, to date, has been unsuccessful in meeting the
mechanical properties achievable by traditional processing methods. The issue is partly due to
time, temperature, and pressure requirements as described above. However, this cannot be
the entire story as well-established fusion bonding processes such as induction welding and
ultrasonic welding are very rapid in nature and still yield strong bonds. The fundamental
difference between these welding processes and in-situ consolidation is in the number of
heating and cooling cycles experienced per ply of the TPC during fabrication and consolidation.
When carbon fiber/thermoplastic plies are consolidated the air trapped between those layers is
condensed by the consolidation pressure and absorbed in the matrix. In-situ consolidation by
AFP, for example heats every ply as it is laid down, and several plies beneath. Each time a layer
is reheated, trapped air expands, eventually leading to interlaminar void formation and reduced
interlaminar mechanical properties.",,
High Lift High Load LPT Blade for Hybrid Engine,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: High Lift High Load LPT Blade Design for Hybrid Turbine Engines
Hybrid electric aircraft concepts, in general, offer the potential to downsize the core design of turbine engines, a
concept currently under examination in the HyTEC program. Additionally, they provide operational benefits
influenced by developments through TTT initiative. Both endeavors aim to enhance the efficiency of turbine engine
components while increasing the overall bypass ratio of the aircraft. It is important to acknowledge that there are
inevitable challenges associated with the downsizing of engine components, which must be addressed. While
HyTEC focuses on promptly finding solutions to these challenges for near future, it is imperative to remain mindful
of and proactively tackle the technical difficulties that might affect such efforts for the long term. On the other
hand, new aircraft concepts like SUSAN and STARC-ABL aim to hybridize aircraft operations by employing turbine
engines to power electric machines, thus further increasing the aircraft's overall bypass ratio. In order fully unlock
the potential advantages offered by these conceptual aircraft architectures, it is imperative to comprehend and
address the challenges and potential enhancements that will impact the turbine engine. In the turbine engine, high
pressure, and low-pressure turbines (HPT and LPT) are responsible for providing the energy to run the high
pressure and low-pressure compressors (HPC and LPC) respectively as well as providing excess energy for auxiliary
components of the aircraft. the significance of the turbines, particularly the LPT, should not be underestimated",,
Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft - a path to zero emissions,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel Aircraft – a path to zero emissions
The work will build upon the dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept first demonstrated
in 1956 to enable a path to low emissions, which reduced demands on renewable energy and
infrastructure, towards zero emissions. The dual hydrogen-jet fuel aircraft concept retains the
wing tanks and economically adds hydrogen to a 737-class single aisle offloading Jet A to retain
the same range enabling flexible aircraft operations and paths forward. Dual Hydrogen-Jet Fuel
aircraft with only 2080km of zero emission range, or 30% hydrogen by energy can reduce
emissions by 50% can be raised to an astonishing 97.5% at lower and more stable fuel costs
than SAF and Jet A. The low energy per unit volume of hydrogen introduces significant aviation
challenges for 100% LH2 fueled aircraft to economically meet the stringent mass, volume, and
safety requirements and the first order optimum is ~30% LH2 by energy. The 97.5% U.S.
emissions reduction will require a change in the airline business model.
The dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept is a significant departure from the 2021 U.S. Aviation
Climate Action Plan based on drop-in carbon-based Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and most
importantly, is not a ‘farther term technology” that also retains the current Aero portfolio to
offset increases in cost. The U.S. Climate Action Plan stated that there was no expectation that
LH2 aircraft would make a significant contribution towards achieving net-zero emissions by
2050. The much slower adoption of hydrogen fuel was also based primarily upon the need to
access renewable energy and to develop ground storage and distribution systems, and to a
lesser extent, upon the need mature electric and hydrogen technologies and to tackle several
other technical and safety challenges. The 2020 European Hydrogen Aircraft study cited a
derived need for ~4300GW for 100% SAF vs 1450 GW for 100% LH2--likely overlooked--while
30% LH2 would require 435 GW, a ten-fold decrease, but must add back liquefaction energy. By
relying on off-grid and excess energy, LH2 production will not have to rely on grid provided
renewable energy. Note that plant based SAF may only achieve 25% carbon emission
reduction, ~4X less than carbon free hydrogen and SAF via direct air capture.
At present, 2050 SAF goals are unstainable beyond ‘not achieving the net-zero by 2050
goal’. In general, limited supply SAF (HEFA) is the lowest cost while unbounded supply based on
direct air capture [a massive green prize] plus green LH2 (PtL/e-kerosene) is the highest cost
fuel. SAF’s have predicted costs 2-10x the cost of Jet A, creating a significant risk to national
and world security, in an attempt to limit aircraft and infrastructure modifications, besides
incorrectly assuming SAF would require less renewable energy and that off-grid, excess
renewable energy is not available, which would favor hydrogen.
The U.S. Climate Action Plan correctly identified that Aviation *must change the fuel* to
meet net zero goals and that technology alone showcased in the in EPFD and TTBW/X-66A
demonstrators would *not* be sufficient. In *contrast*, hydrogen aircraft would become the
pull technology in fewer higher energy locations to help eliminate grid bottlenecks and reduce
emissions in the hard to decarbonize industries. In contrast, rather than remove fuselage and
engines from a MD-90 to form the TTBW/X66A, adding hydrogen tanks could fly the same
number of PAX with hydrogen plumbed to the rear-mounted engines. The Airbus A380 LH2
demonstrator adds a 3rd hydrogen engine cantilevered from the fuselage along with the
hydrogen fuel system and tank. In contrast, while the truss braced wing is an excellent design
for battery and 100% hydrogen aircraft since ~no energy will be carried in the wings, the lower
amount of jet fuel carried must be further considered in a dual hydrogen-jet fuel concept.

Computational Design of Superconductors for Superconducting Aircraft Propulsion Motors,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Computational Design of Superconductors for Superconducting Aircraft Propulsion Motors
All electric airflights offer climate-neutral aviation by greatly reducing carbon emission [1]. However, the
traditional electric motor is limited by its power density, i.e., the power to weight ratio. Superconducting
aircraft propulsion motors have the potential of achieving power densities 2-3 times the state of the art for
machines in the megawatt (MW) or larger class with > 99% efficiency [2]. This requires superconductors
to carry very strong current, and therefore, the superconductor coils [3,4] must be kept well below its
superconducting critical temperature. Currently, the high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs), in
particular, cuprates (such as GdBa2Cu3O7 films) [5] are used in such motors and must be cooled to below
20 K by liquid hydrogen, although their critical temperatures are well above 77 K, the boiling point of
nitrogen. However, liquid hydrogen is not only expensive but also poses a substantial risk to safety.
Previous researches in this field have been focused on designing new structures of the superconducting
motors while employing the existing cuprate HTSCs. Though this approach has led to operational
superconducting motors with much improved energy to weight ratio compared with the traditional ones,
the target MW and larger class are still beyond reach without considering new superconductors which can
carry stronger current and/or at higher temperatures. Such researches on new superconductors require
totally different technical expertise than what the engineering groups working on this filed usually have.
In this project, we propose to computationally design novel superconductors, in addition to current
researches on designing novel motor structures. The combination of these two approaches has the potential
of reaching the desired energy density at a much higher output power scale. Furthermore, previous
theoretical researches [6] on superconductors have been mostly dedicated on predicting the critical
temperatures �!, and very few efforts [7,8] have been spent to consider and calculate the critical current
density as a function of temperature and to find out superconductors with higher critical current. 
Technically, the critical current density �(�) has the same temperature dependence as that of the
superconducting gap amplitude Δ(�), and Δ(�) can be obtained theoretically by solving the coupled
integration equations for superconducting and total charge densities, respectively, which are a direct
consequence of the well-known mean-field BCS theory [9]. To obtain �(�) and Δ(�), firstly, one has to
calculate the critical temperature �!, which depends on a number of physical quantities according to the
BCS relation and the McMillan’s analysis [10]:
�! = �
1.45 exp /− 1 + �
� − �∗(1 + 0.62�)
7
#.%&
.
Here � is the Debye temperature, �∗ the Coulomb repulsion, and � the electron-phonon coupling constant.
These three key quantities are also needed to obtain the parameters in the coupled integration equations.
We note that nowadays �, �∗ and � can be computed by solving the quantum mechanical equations (first-
-principles electronic structure calculations) routinely and accurately, and the calculated �! based on the
above McMillian’s expression can be quantitatively comparable with the measured data. Thus, a
breakthrough has been made in superconductivity research, and one prominent example is the experimental
discoveries of the high-T superconductor SH3 under high pressure after the first-principles calculations
were carried out. In 2014, Duan et al. [11] predicted �! of 200 K under a pressure of 160-200 GPa for SH3,
while in 2015 Drozdov et al. [12] measured �! of 203 K under 160 GPa.
Besides first-principles calculations, machine learning and data mining [13] have been successfully applied
to find new superconductors and to determine their �! [14]. Our group members have employed, tailored
and developed both first-principles and high-throughput computational tools to compute lattice vibrations
(phonons) and electron-phonon coupling in metals and insulators. These tools can be used to accurately
evaluate �, �∗ and � and to fast screen materials by efficiently estimating these quantities. Furthermore,
our group members have used machine learning and data mining methods to study battery materials and
biomaterials, and this expertise is directly transferrable for superconductor research.
Superconductivity research requires close collaborations
between theory and experiments since theory alone or
experiments alone are prone to errors and false claims
[15,16]. Our experimental collaborator, Prof. Chen in
University of Houston, is a world-renowned expert on
HTSC and topological superconductors [17-19].
Combining our theory/computation and their materials
synthesis and characterization will be the key for us to
find out superconductors which can carry stronger
electric current at higher T for making aircraft motors.
As summarized in Figure 1 on the right, there exist five
different types of superconductors forming more than
12,000 known superconductors listed in the SuperCon
database [20]. Guided by the existing data, known
empirical rules and experimental observations, we will
employ the high-throughput screening and machine
learning and data mining to find out potential candidates.
Then we will apply the accurate first-principles methods
to compute �' and �(�) for these materials. Finally, our
theoretical findings of the most promising candidates will

Enhanced Aerogel Composites for Lithium-Ion Battery Performance Safety and Efficiency (ECLIPSE),TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Enhanced Aerogel Composites for Lithium-Ion Battery Performance Safety and Efficiency (ECLIPSE) 

Concern over climate change has created an opportunity and need to target new aircraft technologies for the next generation of single-aisle airliners which account for greater than 50% of worldwide aviation emissions. NASA Projects such as the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) and the Electrified Powertrain Flight Demonstration (EPFD) are tasked with the development of technology and designs for aircraft to meet greener low emission objectives and enable a new generation of electric-powered aircraft. Within the electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) technologies under EPFD, higher efficiency batteries are of significant interest. Over the past few decades, battery technologies have seen exceptional advancement, however, thermal control and thermal runaway continues to be a challenge.  To combat this issue, an advanced material with phase change capability is necessary to absorb or redirect thermal energy during normal operation and protect cells from the extreme heat produced during a thermal runaway event. One such potential material is a Phase Change-Polymer Aerogel Composite (PCPAC), which will offer the advantages of a typical aerogel such as extremely low density (~ 0.1 g/cm3),1 high porosity (> 95%),2 high specific surface area (500–1,000 m2/g),3 and mechanical strength4. 

 
 
Current methods for thermal management and thermal runaway prevention impose a significant weight penalty. Current assumptions when designing an energy storage system for electric aircraft state that 30% of the overall mass of the system is the packaging of the batteries, which includes the methods of thermal management and thermal runaway propagation prevention. To achieve a realistic solution for electrified aircraft, 400 Watt hours/kilogram (Wh/kg) at the battery module level is the minimum energy density limit. Current Lithium-Ion cells have an energy density of up to 250 Wh/kg, giving an energy density of 175 Wh/kg at the battery module. As energy densities at the battery cell level increase, the weight penalty will remain, and possibly even increase based on the advanced cell chemistry characteristics.   Aluminum is mainly used as a thermal and physical barrier between cells and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3. Replacing some of the aluminum used for packaging with a low-density aerogel (0.1 g/cm3) will allow for substantial weight savings and a decreased percentage of parasitic mass for the battery module while also acting as an effective thermal management material and a lightweight barrier to thermal runaway propagation. 
 

In this study we will demonstrate a new approach to 3D printing polyimide aerogel composites with phase change material capability using the facile, cost-effective process of direct ink writing (DIW) without the need for extreme conditions or additional post-processing steps. This will be accomplished by using a dual-head syringe to print the high temperature resistant polymer aerogel in combination with the target temperature polymer to infiltrate the pores whereby the aerogel acts as a host system for the phase change material. Expanding access to non-moldable complex structures via 3D printing will enable aerogels to insulate more complex arrangements of electronic components. Looking forward, the use of custom-fit aerogels for lightweight thermal insulation of batteries can facilitate electric vehicle and electric aviation applications.

Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Thermal Management System Trade Study and Analysis for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Aircraft
1. NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) recently published their updated Strategic
Implementation Plan which calls for increasing focus on sustainable aviation and achieving net-zero CO2
emissions by 2050. Alternative propulsion is an area of specific interest, and one method involves
hydrogen fuel cells. Through NASA’s ongoing Commercially-viable Hydrogen Aircraft for Reduction of
Greenhouse Emissions (CH2ARGE) project, this technology is thoroughly being assessed through different
aircraft design cycles. This project focuses on medium range aircraft with around 180 passengers and a
range of about 2,500 nmi, which falls into the category of short-medium range aircraft that generate about
two-thirds of the CO2 emissions generated by this industryi
.
There are different types of fuel cells, but the basic idea is that by reacting both hydrogen and oxygen gas,
one can produce power with water and heat as byproducts; therefore, if designed properly, the aircraft
can be a net-zero CO2 emitter. A significant obstacle to adopting fuel cells as a power source for aircraft is
that the thermal management system (TMS) must handle multiple challenges. A benefit of fuel cells is
that they are ~50 %, which is higher than the ~30 % efficiency of the traditional jet engine cycle. However,
unlike traditional aircraft, the hot gases generated by the propulsion system don’t just exit through the
back of the engine; rather, in fuel cell systems, the heat is contained in the fuel cell stack and must be
conducted out and either dissipated or put to good use supporting a secondary system. This becomes
problematic as the propulsion system for a mid-size aircraft will require 20 – 25 MW of power, meaning
that the fuel cells will be producing about 10 MW of heat. Ample consideration must also be given to the
quality of heat generated, since heat dissipation to the surroundings becomes more difficult and complex
as the ambient air becomes warmer.
Another significant challenge is that the aircraft’s high energy-dense hydrogen fuel has cryogenic needs
to be operationally feasible. The design of a relevant TMS would require significant consideration for
hydrogen boil-off, refrigeration, insulation, and others, since all are nontrivial technical challenges that
will substantially impact the TMS design. However, the potential a cryogenic hydrogen fuel offers is also
promising, as this opens multiple design paths not offered in traditional aircraft. For example, the TMS
could leverage any boil-off from the tank to condition or further cool critical aircraft components and
potentially open the doors towards super-conducting applications.
All the above are complex problems that must be addressed for net-zero CO2 emissions in aviation to be
successful, which is why it is important that NASA address this problem now. We have conducted a survey
on the different TMS used by various NASA-funded internal and academic projects of similar electrical
scaleii, iii, iv, vand have found the above issues to be consistent challenges facing the industry with increasing
electrification. Promising technologies that would enable a hydrogen fuel cell aircraft include using
oscillating heat pipe spreaders on the aircraft skin vi
, using liquid hydrogen flow loops to cool
componentsvii
, and using thermal storage devicesviii in conjunction with more traditional pumped-fluid
loopsix
.
Despite the many technologies mentioned above, the design of the TMS has consistently been found to
be a major area requiring development that lacks the appropriate priority in the design cycle of aircraft –
it is consistently an afterthought that results in severe performance penalties. With increasing
electrification, the TMS system must now be designed in-tandem with other major systems to develop a
viable aircraft system. To efficiently design a hydrogen aircraft's TMS, we propose developing a novel
design tool that will integrate TMS design with the design of the electrical power system and the
cryogenic hydrogen storage system. This tool will serve as a framework upon which different sizing and 
analysis tools, such as the in-house developed Electrical Power System – Sizing and Analysis Tool (EPSSAT)
x
, will be integrated to enable the iterative co-design of the TMS, power management and distribution
(PMAD) system, and cryogenic system architectures. The flexibility enabled by this tool will allow for the
quick sizing of components while also providing estimates on important performance parameters such as
TMS mass, volume, area required, drag and power penalties for mid-size aircraft, which to the best of
knowledge has not been done before.
This tool will enable us to conduct a trade study on aircraft fuel cell systems operating in two different
temperature regimes: under 100 oC and between 100 - 200 oC. These temperature ranges correspond to
low temperature PEM, a more mature technology, and high temperature PEM, still in the development
phase, fuel cell technology. The trade study will identify and evaluate various TMS architectures and
interfaces, identify design drivers and technology gaps, and identify bounds and industry standards that
will guide the TMS design. Our analysis will identify high priority test cases for each temperature range
with a focus on system mass, volume, and parasitic power requirements. In addition, it will also be used
to inform a more targeted investigation into more effective technologies for cooling large fuel cell stacks.
Our team is proposing to investigate several enabling technologies that could benefit hydrogen fuel cell
aircraft, such as: outer-mold line cooling enabled by oscillating heat pipes; using high-conductivity heat
spreaders; using passive components like conventional heat pipes; using phase-change materials to
handle transients; storing heat in the fuel, and using the product water from the fuel cell as a heat sink.
The balance of plant components, including the cryogenic fuel storage and conditioning system, and the
PMAD system will also be evaluated to provide a more realistic understanding of the TMS.

Commoditization of molecular simulation data for exploration of new aerospace polymers,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,," Title: Commoditization of molecular simulation data for exploration of new aerospace  polymers 

This work proposes to commoditize molecular polymer models by: (1) automating the development of models and their characterization data analysis and (2) developing standard methods allowing models to be compared more easily.  

 

The materials available to design aircraft have a large impact on the capabilities of the aircraft and can be used to define the eras of flight – wood and canvas, aluminum, titanium, fiber reinforced polymer, etc. Traditionally, new materials development is a long-lead and expensive part of new aircraft design. The advent of computational modeling new materials has the potential to advance the efficiency of new material development to accelerate the insertion of new materials to meet challenging aviation goals. For example, non-petroleum derived polymers, polymers for lightweight composites, and low-energy curing polymers can decrease the environmental impact of an aircraft lifecycle. 

 

For state-of-the-art fiber reinforced composite systems, the axial properties are dominated by the fiber, and the purpose of the polymer is to facilitate load transfer between fibers. Properties that depend on this load transfer and therefore on the polymer include fracture toughness, transverse, and shear properties. Improving these properties can reduce the weight of the structure or new non-petroleum-based polymers could be used if their performance can match those of existing polymers. 

 

The problem we are proposing to address is the speed and cost of modeling new polymer materials. Many relevant properties of polymer materials originate from the molecular structure of the polymer and can be predicted using molecular dynamics simulation. However, molecular dynamics models can be time consuming to build and develop, which typically limits in-depth analysis to single polymer systems. Developing new polymers, however, requires screening of many different candidate systems. The individually customized modeling procedures currently in use have costs (time and effort) beyond what is required to generate a large database of properties or to rapidly screen new chemistries. Furthermore, machine learning and other emerging data analysis methods are predicated on the availability of large quantities of reasonably curated data.  

 

There are commercial packages with polymer modeling capabilities, such as the Amsterdam Modeling Suite, Materials Square, and Materials Studio. These are typically wrappers that use the capabilities of open-source molecular dynamics codes and their engine. Often the focus of these commercial packages is “democratizing” molecular models, so the emphasis is on a graphical user interface. The goal of this project though, is to involve as little or no human intervention. Some packages have scripting capabilities, but the user would be required to write the software that performs the automation negating the benefits of the commercial package. 

 

One of the requirements of developing a database of simulation material properties is a set of standardized procedures used to create the polymers and characterize them. For experimental materials, there are standards such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) that allow for comparison of material properties. For molecular models, research groups tend to have their own methods, which vary in ways that may or may not be consequential. To overcome the challenge of standard and repeatable results of molecular models of polymers, what is being proposed is method development to establish standard procedures for computationally guided selection of material properties. 

 

To these ends we are proposing: (1) automation of the generation of molecular models of polymer systems and the characterization of the resulting systems, such that new systems can be rapidly screened and (2) standardization (versioning) of molecular simulation procedures, so the resulting predictions are repeatable and comparable.

Elastocaloric Cooling: The Missing Link in Green Aviation,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Elastocaloric Cooling: The Missing Link in Green Aviation
Elastocaloric materials are currently poised to serve as transformative and efficient solid-state
coolants relevant to TX14 Thermal Management Systems (TX14.2.1 Heat Acquisition and TX14.2.2 Heat
transport) in the 2020 NASA Technology Taxonomy [1] but they have yet to be considered as a major
enabling element for Green Aviation. This year (2023), NASA’s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate
(AMRD) has published a strategic plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050,
whereby hydrogen fuel and other electronic power sources (batteries) are major contenders to replace
carbon-rich fossil fuels. To reach the objective of zero carbon emissions, several milestones must be
reached on a global scale including sourcing and transporting elemental hydrogen, developing hydrogen
combustion systems which burn hotter than fossil-fuels in traditional Brayton cycles [2], implementing
temperature sensitive high-efficiency batteries, and replacing electronics that exhibit losses from joule
heating [3]. Phase change materials (PCMs), such as paraffin wax and heat pipes, have been
implemented in prior studies to overcome these problems, yet their performance relies on specific
ambient conditions and an optimal geometric design for specific duty cycles. Thermal buffering is not
robust enough to keep pace with NASA’s decarbonization efforts. One major limiting factor common to
all these proposed carbon-free technologies (including nuclear) is the peak operating temperature.
Therefore, thermal control is of paramount importance to support the development of Green Aviation.
Current cooling methods rely heavily on vapor-compression technology, whereby, the latent heat of
vaporization of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) produces the cooling effect with which we are familiar. In
vapor form, these HFCs are greenhouse gases, and therefore cannot support the cooling of Green
Aviation systems. Accidental release of HFCs during the filling or catastrophic bursting of over-pressured
refrigerant lines is a major worldwide problem that contributes to global warming. Therefore, several
agencies and countries have supported the development of high-efficiency refrigeration technology free
of HFCs [4].
Elastocaloric materials offer a carbon-neutral solution to replacing HFCs and vapor-compression
refrigerators. In its simplest description, the elastocaloric effect (ECE) is defined as the temperature
change that occurs within a material when it is elastically deformed by a mechanical load.
Thermodynamically, all materials exhibit this behavior, but some, namely shape memory alloys (SMAs),
are capable of super-elastocaloric effects. These super-ECEs are characterized by adiabatic temperature
changes, ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑, of over 20°C and manifest from the latent heat of reversible martensitic phase
transformations [5] driven during superelasticity. Fortunately, SMAs are under current investigation at
NASA for aeronautical actuation, e.g., in vortex generators and aileron motion. Several of their
properties have been measured and stored in databases, and a unique feature of SMAs is their 2-way
thermomechanical coupling which enables their value as coolants. SMAs are energy converters and are
the archetypal candidates for super-ECE cooling systems [6].
In SMAs, reversible martensitic transformations are driven by mechanical stress, 𝜎, temperature (𝑇)
sweeps, and sometimes a magnetic field, 𝐻. If the transition takes place under a constant 𝜎, a large
shape change can be observed as indicated by the alloy’s strain, 𝜖 (superelasticity). 𝜎-driven changes in
heat capacity, 𝐶𝑝, serve as the backbone of the ECE, and in SMAs the latent heat of the reversible
martensitic phase transformation superimposes with the traditional ECE. Fig. 1(a) demonstrates the
large ∆𝑇𝑎𝑑 measured in a NiCoMnTi SMA which was measured to be ≈ ±18°C [7].
Recently, researchers in academia and industry are pushing to exploit super-elastocaloric
technology, but they often rely on bulky tension/compression instrumentation. The coefficient of
performance (COP) is determined based on both material properties and loading type, as shown in Fig.
1b. In Fig. 1b, SMAs subscripted with a “t” or “c” indicate tensile or compressive loading. ",,
Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency 

We are proposing an unconventional compound backward-forward swept wing concept as shown.  

Compound Backward-Forward Swept Wing Design 

The premise of this proposed concept is the potential gain in aerodynamic efficiency which could lead to reduced energy consumption [1]. This could be due to the increased lift as a result of the aeroelastic wash-in twist due to wing bending. This bending-induced lift is given by [2] 

where w is the vertical bending, y is the conventional pitch axis coordinate, and L is the elastic axis sweep angle, negative for forward-swept wing. The flow on the outboard forward swept wing is generally directed inward while the flow on the inboard backward swept wing is generally directed outward [1]. In the transition region, it is hypothesized that the flow would be largely streamwise, resulting in additional increased lift. The inward spanwise flow outboard tends to decrease the wing tip vortices, hence reducing the induced drag [1]. Appropriate geometric twist design can be incorporated to further reduce the wing tip vortices. 

 

Forward swept wing design has been tested on X-29 aircraft [3]. Advantages and disadvantages are well-documented [1]. Improved aerodynamic efficiency and high-angle-of-attack performance are known advantages of forward-swept wing design [1]. Stability and aeroelasticity (bending divergence) are known challenges with forward swept wing design which are generally viewed as major technical barriers [2,3]. A compound backward-forward swept wing could potentially be a transformative design since very little research has been done on this type of wing design. It is believed that the proposed concept would lessen these issues due to the inboard backward swept wing which would compensate for the adverse effects of the outboard forward swept wing, while potentially providing increased aerodynamic efficiency.

The electrification of engines for large single-aisle aircraft (~180 passengers) and integration of these engines onto novel airframes, such as the Subsonic Aft Engine (SUSAN) concept aircraft is a formidable challenge. To realize predicted performance benefits, these engines are more tightly integrated into the fuselages than in the past which implies more cooperation between engine and airframe manufacturers. New design and optimization tools are needed, as well as the data to validate these tools.  New aircraft will need to prove flightworthiness, and certification requirements are not yet established for these new configurations, posing financial and technical risks to manufacturers. Since there are international regulations on aircraft noise and emissions, formulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) Working Group and adopted by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration, cleaner and quieter aircraft have a competitive advantage in the global market.  

How will a large electric aircraft take-off and land safely, cleanly, and quietly on a hot windy day or a cold snowy day?  Heat exchangers and acoustic absorbers will be need co-located inside the fan duct.  Heat exchangers will be needed to keep the motors and controllers cool or to prevent ice from accumulating in the inlet.  Acoustic absorbers are needed to reduce the noise produced by the fan and motor before it can propagate to the cabin and pollute the environment.  While aircraft engine acoustic liners and inlet anti-icing systems are already packaged into today’s turbofan engine inlets, new heat exchangers that will be part of the electric aircraft thermal management system must now be added.   

Traditionally, several components (e.g. rotor, guide vanes, nacelle, liners, heat exchangers) are built separately and assembled modularly. The function of each component is considered separately, and it becomes difficult to optimize the entire system, especially if acoustics and low-noise features are not included early in the component design.  Multifunctional structures to transfer heat and absorb sound, however, offer the promise of reduced weight and improved system performance.  Integrating the acoustic liner into the entire build of a ducted electrofan as a unit is an approach that has not been attempted before.  By using rapid prototyping techniques, the entire assembly can be built as a unit allowing even traditional acoustic technologies to be blended across the engine build. There are several potential benefits to this approach.  First, the total acoustic liner length could be increased which could help reduce noise emissions, especially for engines with short inlets.  Second, when multifunctional structures are tightly integrated into the ducted electrofans, we might be able to avoid seams and steps in the liner that are common problems with traditional liners.  Discontinuities in the acoustic liners can be a source of noise, and eliminating or reducing these discontinuities could improve liner performance and reduce aircraft engine noise pollution. 

NASA’s patented bio-inspired Broadband Acoustic Absorber (aka ‘bioliner’) has utilized additive manufacturing to rapidly prototype bioliner segments for proof-of-concept experiments.  Data from these experiments demonstrate that structures that resemble bundles of natural reeds can absorb sound over a wide frequency range (400 Hz to 3000Hz), and better than state-of-the-art for frequencies between 400 Hz to 1000 Hz. Thin, lightweight, and durable acoustic absorbers effective over a wide frequency range especially for low frequency sounds below 1000 Hz are needed for a broad range of aerospace, industrial, marine, and architectural noise control applications.  Maturation of the bioliner technology can easily be incorporated into the QUEEN development spirals.  

Since the Quiet Electric Engines being designed for the Subsonic Single Aft Engine (QUEEN) 25% Flight Research Vehicle will need to incorporate a heat exchanger that competes for volume within the nacelle that is also needed by the acoustic liner, multifunctional structures that can transfer heat and absorb sound are required.  The bioliner is one promising candidate for this test bed.  Bench tests of multifunctional structures will be needed to develop thermal and acoustic models so that these multifunctional structures can be optimized in the fan integration. Of vital importance to this compatibly is the bioliner team developing a model for design methodology. This is a necessary requirement to effectively mature the bioliner technology. However, early QUEEN prototypes can provide validation data sets for those models and essential design and manufacturability information.  ",,
Durability of Cryotanks for Aircraft via Flow-forming Technology (DuraCrAFT),TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Durability of Cryotanks for Aircraft via Flow-forming Technology (DuraCrAFT) 
Problem: The National Climate Action Plan for Aviation aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. One solution is the maturation of hydrogen-powered aircraft to achieve zero-emission flight. Given the urgency to meet carbon emission reduction targets, a reliable solution to storage of cryofuels is needed. The design and fabrication of cryotanks suitable for commercial aviation present numerous challenges in containing high-pressures (300 bar) at low temperatures (as low as 20 K) while delivering a lightweight, reliable solution. This proposal aims to utilize flow forming, a high-rate, low-cost metal forming process, to adapt the aluminum-lithium (Al-Li) tank design used for spaceflight hardware into unitized Al-Li tank structures that are weight-competitive with composites. 

 Al-Li cryotanks have been used in space flight (e.g. external tanks) or developmental hydrogen-powered cars ​[1]​, however both applications have different requirements than aviation. Cryotanks for space flight, even the reusable versions, do not need to sustain thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles, while automotive cryotanks have more similar lifecycles, though do not need to focus on a lightweight design ​[2]​. Airbus and Universal Hydrogen are reportedly preparing metallic cryotanks for use in hydrogen-powered aircraft, however there is no report of utilizing unitized (less weld length resulting in less leaks) and integrally stiffened (better performance) structures enabled by flow forming ​[3]​. Unitized and integrally stiffened tanks fabricated from Al-Li may offer greater reliability and durability than both conventional metallic and composite designs to sustain the many pressure and temperature cycles of flight and refueling, as well as more easily meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements, such as crashworthiness and inspectability. Additionally, the high costs of composite cryotanks are acceptable for high-budget spaceflight applications. However, for the near-term need of sustainable aviation, the cost of composite cryotanks for aircraft may be prohibitive ​[4]​.  

 While flow forming offers beneficial weight and rate savings over conventional manufacturing, there are still open questions regarding the durability of flow-formed cryotanks for aircraft applications. Flow forming imparts significant coldworking (and potential residual stresses), which raises concerns for the crack initiation and propagation performance over thousands of thermal and pressurization cycles. Additionally, hydrogen embrittlement is a concern for aluminum cryotanks, especially if cracks are introduced. 

The conventional metallic cryotank fabrication approach utilizes welding to piece together dozens of panels to form a tank. However, forming has been shown to reduce weight by 5-8% in large-scale domes and tanks by eliminating a significant fraction of welds through unitization ​[5]​. Additionally, since leaks tend to occur at welded joints rather than acreage, the reduction of the total weld length should create a less permeable structure. The integrally stiffened cryotank serves as a further improvement over the state of the art by reducing the number of secondary reinforcement structures needed. Flow forming a cryotank for aircraft has not been attempted likely due to the limited number of research-grade advanced forming equipment available. The durability of flow-formed cryotanks is largely unknown and must be understood in order mature this technology, thus starting with fatigue testing and residual stress measurements is a logical first step. 
 
This proposal aims to survey and elucidate the not-well-understood durability of flow-formed structures for long-life aircraft applications, specifically targeting the crack initiation behavior of flow-formed parts under cyclical loading. Tayon et al. ​[6]​ have shown improved toughness in flow formed aluminum 6061 as compared to wrought plate, however other durability issues such as fatigue strength and crack propagation are unexplored. Instead of relying on a build and test strategy to demonstrate durability, this proposal sets the stage by collecting data needed to develop predictive models. The predictive capabilities should reduce the need for excessive characterization and testing as cryotank (and future structure) designs change. Coupling a finite element model (DEFORM) that predicts microstructure and a crack formation and propagation model allows for intelligent, efficient process optimization instead of lengthy empirical approaches. If successful, this proposal could result in a pathway to a reliable, cost-effective, manufacturable metallic cryotank capable of meeting net-zero carbon aviation goals. Secondly, the capability of predicting flow-formed microstructures and mechanical properties can be leveraged for efficient design and production of other flow-formed aerospace structures such as fuselages, nacelles, nozzles, and nose cones.

Stator core material development for next generation electric motors,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Stator core material development for next generation electric motors 
What problem are you solving? NASA identifies Electrified Aircraft Propulsion (EAP) as a leading strategy to reduce fuel usage and CO2 emissions associated with aviation. Across the competing EAP system topologies, common power density targets have been identified for electric motors (>10 kW/kg) and the associated power electronics (>20 kW/kg) to enable closed designs and compete with existing turbine power densities (~13 kW/kg) [1]. Significant research is focused on the development and demonstration of subsystems and systems that meet the difficult requirements for this application. The current state of the art for aviation rated electric motors is assessed to be 5-7 kW/kg [2], approximately half the target value. This proposal targets improvement in the magnetic material used in electric motor stators to achieve the targeted power density. Power in a motor is given as 𝑃 = 𝜏𝜔, where 𝜏 is the torque and 𝜔 is the rotational speed. Strategies to increase motor power density seek to increase these parameters. Torque is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field between the rotor and stator (airgap flux density), and the radius Maxwell force. Large radii are not preferred for aviation applications due to drag and volume considerations, so that large flux densities are preferred to increase torque. High performance motors typically use FeCo alloys that have saturation flux densities near 𝐵𝑠 = 2.4 T, the highest value of any known bulk industrial material. No known pathways exist to develop bulk ferromagnetic materials with higher flux densities, but superconducting machines offer a possible solution if the necessary cryogenic conditions can be maintained. The rotational speed of aviation propulsion motors is typically 2-3 krpm, limited by tip speed for direct drive connections. Faster motor speeds may be possible with the addition of reduction gearing, that is common in many aircraft applications and has a relatively low impact to the total power density [3]. Other possibilities exist for direct drive use of high-speed motors or engine driven generators that operate near turbine speeds (15-20 krpm). High power motors in this speed range are common for terrestrial applications such as gas compression or fly wheel storage but no demonstrations exist for MW-scale high speed aviation motors[4]. Motor components that produce AC flux (soft magnetic materials and windings) produce heat proportional to the electrical frequency, and thermal management limits the maximum speed a motor can achieve. Improved thermal systems, high temperature materials, and different motor topologies can mitigate these effects but improved magnetic materials that can operate efficiently at high frequency without excess heat production enable power density improvements without contributing to the thermal problem. Given the lack of a research path toward improving torque, we identify the increase of motor speed as the most likely path to achieve the required >2X improvement in non-superconducting aircraft electric motor power density. Many different motor topologies exist, with brushless DC permanent magnet motors currently showing the highest power densities along with promising results from switched reluctance designs that require more complex controls. This can be attributed to the lack of rotor windings and mainly DC rotor flux that does not generate frequency related heat in these topologies. The stator and stator windings of these designs produce the required AC flux and we target the stator for improvement. Due to the variations in motor design, we propose the development of a motor stator capable of flux densities near the current state of the art (>1.5 T) with power losses at high frequency (>2 kHz) less than those produced in current materials at 1 kHz. This sets a performance target and motivates the development of a low loss, high saturation induction magnetic material and a manufacturing process to package this material into a suitable stator. Has this been tried before? Why/why not? Losses in laminated metallic soft magnetic materials have two components; those that are dependent or independent of the excitation frequency. The frequency dependent components are mostly related to eddy currents that are inversely proportional to the lamination. Recent commercial efforts successfully reduced motor stack lamination thickness in bulk crystalline FeCo alloys(Hiperco, Vacoflux, etc…) down to 50 μm [5,6], resulted in a 2X reduction in losses compared to previous lamination thicknesses (Figure 1 left). The measured core loss of ~50 W/kg at 1 kHz is the upper limit of thermal load for a conventional motor design. Therefore, thinner laminations allow for higher excitation frequency for the same thermal load. While this is a significant improvement, the frequency independent component of losses in bulk crystalline alloys are high due to the large grain size and significant magnetostriction. No bulk crystalline materials with saturation induction Bs>1.5 T and zero magnetostriction are currently known. Figure 1: Comparison of core losses (W/kg) vs induction (T) in a bulk crystalline FeCo alloy with 50μm thick laminations to a similar alloy with 6mil (150μm) laminations at 1kHz (left) and a FeSi-based nanocomposite at 5kHz (right). We propose improvements to stator performance beyond what is possible in bulk crystalline stator materials with grain size typically >10 μm. Nanocomposite soft magnetic materials produced from rapidly solidified amorphous ribbon can have significantly lower losses compared to thin crystalline FeCo motor alloys (Figure 1 right). This is due to the small grain size (20ppm) or FeSi-based nanocomposites with low saturation induction (10 W/kg. 2. Milestones The concept described above, through the final demonstration of low losses in a packaged stator, represents a development effort greater than 1 year. The proposed work for this project seeks to assess feasibility and demonstrate a proof of concept: • 3mo - Identify research paths to produce nanocomposite alloys with Bs>1.5 T and low magnetostriction |λs|1.5 T and |λs|",,
Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Optimization of High Voltage Cables for Electrified Propulsion 
Development and implementation of electrified propulsion systems are a key component to achieving the green aviation targets laid out in the ARMD Strategic Implementation Plan. Electrified propulsion requires achieving high energy densities, either through improved energy storage technologies or reduced weight of aircraft components. Regarding the latter, electrified propulsion is expected to lead to an increase in the required electrical wiring. Therefore, developing lightweight, high voltage, i.e., for high power, cables is desirable. Cables consist of an inner electrical conductor surrounded by insulating material.  Both conductor and insulation materials require optimization.  Here we focus on the inner conductor.  Recently, a study from Glenn Research Center by Almansour et al. [1] investigated the possibility of replacing pure copper (Cu) conductors with Cu-coated carbon nanotube (CNT) composites. They found, through a trial-and-error process of testing different fabrication techniques and composite compositions, that it was possible to increase electrical conductivity by 4.8% compared to traditional Cu cables. As a result, these Cu/CNT composite cables, able to deliver the same amount of power as state-of-the-art Cu cables, offered a 13.5% weight reduction. Despite this success, the properties of different Cu/CNT samples were inconsistent due to difficulty in achieving a uniform Cu coating on the CNTs (Figure 1). Nonuniform Cu coatings also made the cables more susceptible to failure when placed under stress. A better understanding of the basic Cu deposition processes underlying Cu/CNT fabrication would undoubtedly help to optimize the process and produce cables with consistently improved properties. Using physics-based modeling, this work aims to provide strategies for how uniform Cu coatings can be deposited onto CNTs. Optimized Cu/CNT fabrication should be able to produce cables with >20% weight reduction compared to state-of-the-art Cu cables.

We plan to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study how Cu atoms attach to the Cu-CNT interfaces. MD simulations are a technique which allows for the tracking of the motion of individual atoms in a system using a parametrized interatomic potential (force field) model. Cu deposition is an atomic scale process which is well-suited to study with this technique. MD simulations have been utilized extensively to study the mechanical behavior of composites composed of Cu and different carbon allotropes [2,3] as well as the growth of graphene on Cu surfaces (Figure 2) [4,5]. Therefore, there are several existing interatomic potential models which can be utilized to perform new MD simulations of the Cu coating process. The atomic scale resolution of MD simulations will provide insights into the fabrication of Cu/CNT composites previously inaccessible to experimental techniques. 

We expect that the curvature resulting from the CNT radius will affect Cu deposition. Therefore, an initial series of MD simulations will be performed with a flat sheet of graphene (an unrolled CNT) to serve as a comparison and testbed for different simulation conditions. The Cu deposition will be performed at several different rates and temperatures to determine how this affects formation of the Cu layer. Deposition parameters favoring the formation of a uniform Cu coating will be carried over into subsequent simulations. Additionally, graphene, and as a result CNTs, are known to possess several structural defects [6], including vacancies, adatoms, and dislocations, which could serve as preferential sites for Cu attachment. Deposition simulations of Cu in the presence of structural defects will indicate if such “nucleation sites” favor the formation of nonuniform coatings and would thereby be detrimental to Cu/CNT composite fabrication. 

The second series of simulations will focus directly on CNTs. Depending on how the carbon atoms are connected, CNTs can have two different conformations (“armchair” and “zigzag”) in addition to having variable radii. Indeed, in the study done by Almansour et al. [1] the CNTs were not characterized – effectively random CNT characteristics could have contributed to the inconsistency in Cu/CNT composite properties. Therefore, MD simulations will be performed to deposit Cu atoms on CNTs of varying characteristics and elucidate how this may impact the quality of the resulting Cu coating. These MD simulations will provide strategic insight into how the Cu deposition process can be tuned to produce Cu/CNT composites with a desirable uniform Cu coating. This will enable dramatically more consistent fabrication of Cu/CNT cables which offer significant weight savings over existing Cu cables for application in electrified propulsion systems.

Integration of hydrogen fuel tanks in aircraft design - volume study,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Integration of hydrogen fuel tanks in aircraft design - volume study 
The objective of the study is to review the vehicle configuration and structural design issues related to the integration of fuel tanks for storage of liquid or gaseous hydrogen into novel forms of aircraft design. The motivation for this study is that efficient hydrogen storage is a key enabling technology for the advancement of sustainable aviation applications, including hydrogen-powered conventional aviation concepts as well as the design of revolutionary environmentally friendly vehicles.  

Compared to jet fuel, hydrogen has a gravimetric density that is 2.8 times higher than jet fuel. However, even in a liquid state (LH2), hydrogen has a 4.1 times lower volumetric density than jet fuel. Taken together, this this means LH2 requires larger tanks that must be maintained at cryogenic temperatures, even though hydrogen has 2.8 times more energy per kilogram than jet fuel. Compared to liquid hydrogen, gaseous hydrogen (GH2) needs to be compressed and, for conventional tanks, the operating pressure is typically not higher than 700 bar. Even at this high pressure and room temperature, the gas density is 1.8 times less than liquid hydrogen, which means less hydrogen for a given tank size. Larger tanks would be needed to store the same amount of hydrogen as liquid hydrogen tanks. For the current gaseous hydrogen tanks, pressurized to 700 bars, the tank volume to store the same amount of energy would be 7.5 times that of the JP-7 fuel tank.  

Therefore, three problems related to tank design and integration into overall vehicle design are: tank volume, to which tank structural mass is related, and tank materials which are related to decrease of structural mass. Hydrogen tanks have larger volumes because of lower values of liquid or gaseous hydrogen volumetric energy densities than conventional aircraft fuel. The extremely high operation pressure of gaseous hydrogen, which would equal 2,000 bar to pack the same energy as LH2 in the same volume, results in unacceptable structural mass with traditional materials. The technology readiness levels for the expected nano materials are not high enough to consider them in the tank design in the foreseeable future.

Initial Study of Airspace Operational Impacts of Airline Contrail Mitigation Actions,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Initial Study of Airspace Operational Impacts of Airline Contrail Mitigation Actions  
The aviation community is actively tackling a potentially significant contributor to global climate change: persistent contrails formed from aviation operations. The Contrail Impact Task Force—which includes most major U.S.-based airlines (e.g., American, Alaska, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, United, UPS), several international carriers, NASA, Boeing, Airbus, GE, Google, Breakthrough Energy, academia, and other research organizations—is concerned that airspace operations could be a potential barrier to performing contrail avoidance actions as part of routine flight operations. 

There is a need to perform an initial analysis of whether such a potential barrier exists and, if so, the scope of the challenge. This analysis requires an independent, trusted source that has credibility with airspace and air traffic modeling, which NASA has and can provide. The initial results would have broad visibility in the aviation community and can help air carriers plan upcoming flight trials and incorporate contrail formation avoidance actions into accepted operational flight plans. 

The first part of the proposed effort is to calculate ATC-related metrics (e.g., sector counts, proximity events) across the NAS utilizing existing simulation data collected during a prior study commissioned by the ARMD Portfolio Analysis and Management Office (PAMO). The NAS-wide analysis proposed here—1) identify specific “hotspot” areas of the NAS that require deeper dive analysis; 2) uncover airspace complexities of contrail formation avoidance that may require additional algorithm development; and 3) raise additional questions for follow-on research—has not been conducted previously. Prior analysis of four sectors in Kansas City Center found that contrail avoidance actions would not lead to an increase in sector counts above capacity.1-2 However, the researchers did not extend this analysis to the entire NAS in follow-on studies. Instead, they focused on 1) refining their environmental impact models of contrails; and 2) comparing contrail formation avoidance strategies in terms of the tradeoff in fuel burn and delay. 

The second part of the proposed effort is to receive and incorporate into NAS-wide simulations flight plan data from a major airline that includes 1) realistic business preferences; and 2) vertical and lateral flight plans, with and without changes for contrail avoidance (e.g., American Airlines (AA); potentially leveraging an existing Space Act Agreement (SAA)). This would be unprecedented research that the aviation community could utilize to shape the future approach for routine operationalization of contrail avoidance. 

The first part of the proposed effort will be documented in an interim report and presented to NASA, the Contrail Impact Task Force, and other stakeholders. The second part of the proposed effort will be added to the interim report to produce a final report that will also be presented to stakeholders and published. The final report will also document a validation of the contrail formation model utilized in the proposed effort that will include comparing model outputs to satellite images.

Sustainable bio-aerogels for direct air carbon capture and storage,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Sustainable bio-aerogels for direct air carbon capture and storage (to address climate change)
As outlined in the US 2021 Aviation Climate Action Plan, the aviation industry has an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 [1]. For this purpose, governments and aircraft manufacturers are developing and pursuing action plans and technologies such as developing more efficient aircraft (e.g., hybrid and electric aircraft) and using low-carbon alternative fuels (e.g., biofuels) to reduce the aviation carbon footprint [2]. However, these efforts are not enough for the industry to meet its carbon reduction goals as the global demand for air travel is rising. Therefore, complementary solutions are needed to offer a safe, affordable, and scalable pathway for aviation emission reduction.  

Recently, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technology was proposed by the major industry players as a complementary plan to capture the residual emissions remaining from aircraft directly from the air and later store them underground [3]. Although these proposed ground facilities can potentially capture tons of carbon directly from the air, they require so much energy to capture carbon dioxide, purify it, and transport it underground for permanent storage which make them not an affordable and scalable way to sequester carbon [4].  

In this proposal, an alternative approach for capturing carbon dioxide directly from air will be investigated by developing novel sustainable bio-based aerogels. Bio-aerogels are low-density materials with high open-porosity and high specific surface area that are made from biodegradable polymer precursors such as proteins, starch, sugar cane and vegetable oils. Recent developments have shown these materials are excellent for various applications like environmental remediation [5]. The NASA GRC Polymer Aerogel Team has recently considered a new chemistry for the synthesis of bio-based aerogels that can be potentially utilized for carbon dioxide adsorption, and storage. These materials can be chemically functionalized using specific moieties such as organic amines to adsorb carbon dioxide directly from air into their nanoporous structures under ambient conditions. The significance of using bio-aerogels for environmental remediation applications in comparison with traditional polymer aerogels is in their ability to decompose into natural substances in a short period of time which is increasingly important for a sustainable future. In addition to this added benefit, the bio-aerogel still retains typical aerogel properties such as lightweight, low density, low thermal conductivity, acoustic impedance, and structural integrity from cryogenic temperatures to 500 °C. 

The utilization of bio-aerogels with carbon dioxide adhesion capability in Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) based technologies can significantly reduce the overall cost of these systems: 1) it will create a more environmentally-friendly process and be more attractive to industry as the bio-aerogels will be used for the carbon dioxide capture without any purification need, 2) these materials will also act as natural filter with high storage capacity due to their high porosity (>95%) and high internal surface area (800m2/g), and 3) due to their sustainability and biocompatibility, they can be directly stored underground without any environmental concern.",,
Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Eco-Friendly Thermal Management Solutions to Enable Green Aviation 

The aviation industry is a rapidly growing sector with an increasing environmental impact. At just a fraction of the global production, Airbus’s fleet forecast alone projects a 4.1% compounding annual growth rate and over 40,000 new aircraft and freighters to be required over the next 20 years [1]. Consequently, meeting both net zero emissions and sustainability goals requires next generation aircraft to incorporate reusability and recyclability of materials in their design criteria, creating a closed-loop lifecycle, while simultaneously providing performance gains for improved efficiency. 

By leveraging eco-friendly thermal management solutions, aircraft, in particular electrified and hybrid aircraft, and urban air mobility (UAM) systems can benefit from reduced operating temperatures with enhanced efficiency while also taking advantage of material recyclability for reuse in a sustainable closed-loop product lifecycle. Component systems such as batteries, fuel cells, and electric motors provide large opportunity for impact where increased specific power, energy and reliability could be achieved through improved thermal management and contribute to improved aircraft efficiency and reduced emissions. Specifically, this proposal will target the enhancement of electric motors for aircraft propulsion through the development of multifunctional high thermal conductivity bobbins that extract, store, and redistribute the generated heat. In electric motors, bobbins are the permanent containers for the retention of coiled wire shapes and rigidity, and enable easier assembly of the windings into or onto the magnetic core. Given that these coils are the greatest source of heating within the stator and typically within the whole electric motor, efficient thermal management through the bobbin is critical to motor performance. 

Based on a study for NASA electrified aircraft propulsion (EAP) electric motor design, the stator winding thermomechanical stress is a more significant limiting factor for electric motors than thermochemical aging of the insulation [2]. For this reason, cooling strategies and technologies that reduce thermally induced stator coil mechanical stress are needed to advance the achievable performance of EAP motors. One path forward to achieve reduced coil mechanical stress is through an in-slot direct cooling design [3]. Additionally, a recent study at NASA GRC leveraged a multi-physics design optimization model to demonstrate mass reduction achieved with an in-slot design relative to a water-jacket design, as well as increased motor efficiency by incorporating a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity [4].  

Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material designs to advance electric motor state-of-the-art through enhanced thermal management capabilities and reduced thermo-mechanical stress. Multi-material including ceramics, high-performance composites, alumina-filled Polyetherketoneketone (PEKK), carbon-reinforced Polyetherimide (ULTEM), Silicon Carbide, and Boron Nitride are prime candidates demonstrating desired properties for this application. Combined with in-house additive manufacturing capabilities and prior success 3D printing multi-materials [5, 6, 7], designs incorporating complex geometry, cooling channels, or reduced weight could also be achieved. This is especially beneficial with fabricating materials that are difficult to machine through traditional methods and could provide new avenues for the application of these materials. Moreover, thermal storage materials such phase change materials (PCM) can be integrated into the bobbins design to store the extracted heat from the motor wiring and then recycle and use the stored thermal energy elsewhere in the aircraft. Additionally, high thermal conductivity interface coatings which facilitate increased thermal extraction from the coil winding to bobbin could be also investigated.  

Although there has been plenty of work in motor design for propulsion, there has not been a large focus on material development and thermal management for the bobbin component. In one study, a negative correlation with increasing bobbin thermal conductivity and decreased bobbin temperature, achieved through injected molded plastics with fillers, was demonstrated [8]. Another investigation found similar results for a direct winding heat exchanger design [9]. Research in this area is multi-faceted and has not fully explored the potential of thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-materials, where polyamides and glass-fiber reinforcement have been the common materials currently used [10, 11]. Therefore, an opportunity for fabricating an electric motor with improved efficiency is provided by developing a bobbin with increased thermal conductivity for enhanced thermal management. This design should also balance a reduced mass and provide sufficient reduction in thermo-mechanical stresses for improved and reliable performance. Overall, the enhanced efficiency of electric motors and the reduction of power losses due to excess heat will expand the capabilities of electrified aircraft and UAM while increasing sustainability and durability. Furthermore, thermoplastics such as PEKK and ULTEM provide an opportunity for further mitigating waste and emissions through recycling, as they can be recovered, remelted, and reused for fabrication in a closed-loop cycle for green aviation.  

 

Several milestones are anticipated for this work: 

Identify thermally conductive electrically insulative multi-material architecture for bobbin fabrication (12/2023) 

Design and develop processing conditions for successful multi-material additive manufacturing (5/2024) 

Evaluate multi-material composite thermal and thermomechanical properties under simulated operational environmental conditions (7/2024) 

Fabricate proto-type components using additive manufacturing approaches (9/2024) 

This work should be evaluated on the successful fabrication of a bobbin as well as its thermal management capability, where increased thermal conductivity and reduced maximum bobbin temperature will demonstrate improved performance relative to a baseline design. Additionally, the developed bobbin’s ability to extract heat will be measured with the use of customized experimental setup. 

 

Upon successful fabrication of a thermally conductive electrically insulative bobbin, next steps could include further material development and incorporating fabricated components in a motor prototype. A full evaluation of enhanced thermal management for an enhanced motor and a baseline motor could be conducted for comparison, for instance at NASA AFRC or at GRC with small motor test facilities established under CAMIEM. Additionally, more complex components and improved integration within the electric motor could be investigated and tests conducted to determine performance gains over the baseline motor. This could include consolidating multiple components into a single manufacturing step, such as 3d printing a bobbin with copper coils simultaneously. This could result in reduced number of parts, reduced failure points, and reduced weight. There may also be opportunities for transition and collaboration with other NASA projects such as testing with the in-slot cooling rig being constructed under RVLT or the statorette heating cooling rig at GRC. At a later stage this could also involve identifying an opportunity for an in-flight test such as with the sustainable flight demonstrator project. Upon successful demonstration, this technology could also be transferred to engine companies.  

 

With the array of in-house additive manufacturing capabilities available, we are able to 3D print even the highest-performance high-temperature materials available on the market and do not anticipate any feasibility issues. However, if issues do arise, fabrication could be outsourced to local vendors. If there is an issue regarding the chosen thermally conductive electrically insulative material, whether its printability or performance, alternative materials could be used for fabrication. If the entire approach was deemed infeasible, alternative thermal management solutions could be explored. Battery housings and heat sinks leveraging these materials could be fabricated to assist with the prevention and mitigation of thermal runaway events. This is of critical importance for the adoption of electrified aircraft for green aviation and could provide both thermo-mechanical robustness alongside weight savings and increased power density. Additionally, the fabrication of heat exchangers with multifunctional materials for extreme environments could serve to provide enhanced thermal management capability alongside improved reliability and performance. A novel design incorporating lightweight high-performance materials could also be fabricated through additive manufacturing and contribute to weight reduction of the aircraft.

Integrated Catalytic Converters for Air Vehicle NOx Emission Control,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Integrated Catalytic Converters for Air Vehicle NOx Emission Control 
This work has the ambition to design a catalytic converter for NOx emission control using computational methods targeted for an aircraft engine environment. Uncontrolled emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), formed as side-products during combustion of jet fuel, is a global environmental and health hazard.[1] Notably, NOx causes acid rain, smog, and eutrophication. In addition, NOx indirectly contributes to global warming through a complex reaction network that generates the greenhouse gases ozone and nitrous oxide. The adverse influence is significant as the effective global warming potential of NOx is estimated to be 30-35 times that of CO2 over a 20 years perspective.[2] Unfavorably for aircrafts, the harm increases when NOx is emitted at higher altitudes. While emission of NOx from automobile combustion engines has been successfully reduced using catalytic converters, the corresponding emission control is lacking for air vehicles. A key obstacle to the implementation of traditional catalytic converters in aircraft is its negative impact on the performance of the engine. For efficient NOx conversion, the exhaust gas needs extended contact time with the catalyst’s surface by passing the gas over a catalyst-impregnated filter bed. For aircraft, such an arrangement would result in decreased jet thrust – thus reducing engine performance to an unacceptable level. Leveraging the years of industrial research on NOx emission control for automobiles, this project aims to outline pathways toward alternative designs of catalytic converters for state-of-the-art jet engines. Furthermore, the aspiration is to enable codesign of future engines with the vision of power-efficient and truly carbon-neutral jet aircraft of tomorrow.  Such aircraft of the future will be optimized for both performance and emissions reduction. In this project, we will tailor, using advanced computational methods, novel catalysts targeted for aircraft engine environments and NOx reduction. As far as the author is aware, this modeling effort (albeit state-of-the-art in catalysis research) is a novel direction for catalytic converters designed for aircraft that can open up multiple future avenues in green aviation research. 

The overall objective of the proposed project is to lay the theoretical foundation for the design of an integrated catalytic converter for high velocity airflows. The converter solution will be optimized for aircraft conditions and will be applied as a surface coating on components within the jet engine (see Figure 1). This would result in minimal influence on the propulsion with the aim to reduce a significant fraction (1-5%) of the NOx emission. Hence, the converter will be designed to balance engine performance and emission reduction. With a combined annual NOx emission from global air traffic of 106 ton or 30×106 ton CO2,eq (i.e., same order of magnitude as the total energy related CO2 emission of a mid-sized US state),[1,3,4] removing even a small portion of the total NOx emission would have a large beneficial impact on both global health and global warming. Additionally, the modeling framework developed here will be specifically developed to have flexibility to address NOx abatement in other engine systems to allow for design of future jet engine solutions approaching 100% greenhouse gas neutrality.    

We will leverage established modeling methods used for identification of the so-called “three way catalyst” (Pt) used for NOx emission control in automobiles.[5,6] We aim to recast these established models in the context of air vehicles that operate at different conditions and have altered design criteria compared to automobiles. In particular, it is believed that the optimal catalyst could vary within the combustion chamber and turbine along with variations in local temperature, pressure, and gas velocity. In addition, materials durability (including high-temperature stability) and expense will be auxiliary design criteria allowing for a trade-off between catalysts performance and cost.

Health Monitoring for Mechanical and Electrochemical Degradation in Structural Batteries,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Health Monitoring for Mechanical and Electrochemical Degradation in Structural Batteries.   
Batteries are critical for powering future zero emissions vehicle concepts in the automotive, aerospace (e.g., urban air mobility, hybrid/all electric aircraft), industrial (e.g., autonomous drones), and consumer sectors (Figure 1 ​[1]​).  Recently, “massless” structural batteries have emerged that are capable of both supporting structural loads and storing energy​ [2]​.  They are called “massless” because they store energy in structures already needed in aircraft designs, thus no extra mass is required for separate battery storage.  The energy density and multifunctionality of structural batteries will allow a paradigm shift for electrical vehicle designs, leading to increased range and performance as well as a new generation of vehicle designs not possible using conventional batteries.  For these multifunctional battery structures to achieve their full potential, they must be used without external battery management systems.  At the same time, their safety must be guaranteed, especially for manned vehicle applications.  The proposed work aims to address safety assurances for future massless structural batteries by nondestructively studying mechanical and electrochemical degradation mechanisms in these newly developed batteries.  The ultimate goals of this work are (a) to build an understanding of the degradation mechanisms of massless structural batteries and (b) to establish and demonstrate inspection techniques that can be applied during operation to inform maintenance actions and grounding of aircraft before catastrophic failure.     

Health monitoring for batteries is important for their safe operation, especially in power-hungry electric aircraft where batteries are stressed through high discharge rates and extreme operating environments.  Battery health monitoring is a new field, with much of the focus in the research community on commercial lithium-ion battery chemistries and their state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC) (e.g., ​[3]​, ​[4]​).  Measurements of the SOC and SOH are meant to determine when batteries need to be changed, not on whether they are safe for operation.  On the other hand, NASA’s recent work under the CAS SPARRCI program sought to monitor the internal structure of batteries using resonance-based and guided wave ultrasonic methods ​[5]​.  The developments under SPARRCI included successful monitoring of structural resonance changes in lithium metal batteries during the electrochemical cycling process (Figure 2), as well as a demonstration of in-situ application of the developed techniques.  The resonance-based approaches identified under SPARRCI allow through-thickness structure and material property changes to be monitored, and guided wave approaches allow broad area coverage and localization of damage.  

In the composite massless batteries that will be explored, the resonance-based methods (local) and guided wave methods (long range) will be applied to allow multi-scale monitoring of battery and structural health during mechanical and electrochemical cycling.  The work will leverage expertise developed in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of battery health within in LaRC’s Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Branch (NESB) as well as composite and battery fabrication expertise in LaRC’s Advanced Materials and Processing Branch.

Persistent Solar Power Station,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Persistent Solar Power Station 
We are proposing a persistent high-altitude long-endurance (HALE) solar power station. The idea involves an airborne solar panel carried by two HALE aircraft operating at high altitude over a long duration. This is illustrated in the following figure. The electric propulsion on the HALE aircraft is powered by the energy harvested by the solar panel. The power provided by the solar panel can be beamed to UAM aircraft, enabling the aircraft to extend ranges and operate with more passenger capacity. The power can also be beamed to a ground station for energy storage. 

NASA Helios was a solar powered UAV designed by Aerovironment [1]. The first flight ended in a mishap. Subsequent investigations attributed one of the causes of the mishap to ""nonlinear stability and control problem involving complex interactions among the flexible structure, unsteady aerodynamics, flight control system, propulsion system, the environmental conditions, and vehicle flight dynamics."" As a result, the accident investigation board made several recommendations one of which is to ""Develop more advanced, multidisciplinary (structures, aeroelastic, aerodynamics, atmospheric, materials, propulsion, controls, etc) “time-domain” analysis methods appropriate to highly flexible, “morphing” vehicles."" 

The goal of the Helios was largely unfulfilled. If successful, it could have heralded in a new aerospace infrastructure program that could have wide ranging applications from providing power to internet services anywhere in the world.  ",,
Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Thrust Generation in Electrified Aircraft Heat Exchanger Ducts 
Large electrified aircraft produce orders of magnitude more electronics heat than even the most advanced electrical systems on current aircraft. More heat means more drag on ram-air heat exchangers (HXs), which are the existing state of the art for aircraft heat rejection. Ram-air HXs sized for electrified aircraft could create so much drag and weight that they could negate the benefits from electrification [1,2]. A HX that not only eliminates drag but creates thrust would solve this problem. 

There has been a renewed interest in thrust-producing HXs via the Meredith effect [3,4,5]. Meredith effect HXs were previously used in some WWII-era piston engine aircraft, like the P-51 Mustang. Current passenger aircraft do not utilize these designs because jet engines naturally have higher air cooling. Additionally, engine oil heat is typically used to pre-heat the fuel or is rejected via a surface heat exchanger installed in the bypass duct rather than in a standalone duct. However large electrified aircraft likely cannot rely completely on surface (or outer mold line) heat exchangers and will need to reject heat via a pumped-fluid loop to a ram-air heat exchanger [6,7]. The majority of proposed electrified aircraft architectures utilize a single-phase pumped fluid loop [8] operating at temperatures up to 200 °C, which makes them an ideal candidate for a Meredith effect HX. The recent analytical work has shown the potential for thrust production in electrified aircraft HX ducts, however, to date there is little to no evidence that any designs have been built or tested. 

The proposed work would determine the feasibility of a thrust-producing HX for a hybrid-electric aircraft in realistic operating conditions, evaluating potential thrust vs. rejection temperature. This would involve sizing and optimization of the ducted HX at each rejection temperature. If thrust can be produced at a reasonable rejection temperature, a sub-scale HX core would be built and tested at design and off-design operating conditions to measure generated thrust. The HX itself would be of the microchannel type, which have been shown to have higher performance and lower drag and compared to the typical plate-fin heat exchangers used in aviation [9]. The HX would utilize additive manufacturing techniques, which can create the complex microchannel structures more easily and affordably then traditional chemical etching and diffusion bonding processes. HX materials to be investigated include metals as well as plastics, which have recently shown potential benefits in a number of different heat exchanger applications [10,11]. If successful, this work would demonstrate light-weight and zero net drag thermal management which is an enabling technology for NASA’s long-term goals of net-zero carbon emissions from aviation.

Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems: Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Ion Propulsion Systems and Advanced Multi-Sensor Perception for Unmanned Aerial Systems: Leveraging Space Exploration Advances for Sustainable Terrestrial Aviation 

The rapid advancement of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) technology has revolutionized the aviation industry. However, traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms pose significant limitations, including noise pollution, low energy efficiency, and limited maneuverability. These issues are especially evident in residential settings and sensitive environments where noise and emissions are disruptive. While space exploration has widely adopted ion propulsion, terrestrial applications, particularly in UAS, remain under-explored due to challenges like atmospheric drag. Nonetheless, the promise of silent operations, zero emissions, and minimized waste offers a tantalizing prospect for green aviation. Advances by organizations like Undefined Technologies² and MIT³ have proven the viability of IPS for Earth-bound applications. 

This project aims to develop a sustainable alternative to conventional UAS propulsion mechanisms by integrating ion propulsion systems (IPS), a technology deeply rooted in space exploration, into UAS. This innovative approach promises significant advancements in UAS propulsion, including reduced noise and emissions, enhanced energy efficiency, and increased maneuverability. The project will begin with a comprehensive literature review to assess the current state of the art in ion propulsion systems (IPS) technology and its potential applicability to UAS. This review will inform the development of a specialized sensor system and the integration of a deep learning system directly into the IPS. This innovative approach will ensure that UAS not only benefit from sustainable propulsion but also gain from superior diagnostics and efficiency. In addition, the project will incorporate a Multi-Sensor Perception System (MsPs) that uses neuromorphic-computing-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) to provide real-time feedback on the performance of the IPS and develop advanced diagnostic and predictive maintenance algorithms. 

The successful integration of IPS into UAS is expected to have a profound impact on UAS applications across multiple sectors. By significantly reducing noise and emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency and maneuverability, IPS-powered UAS will open up new possibilities for UAS operations in residential zones and other environmentally sensitive areas. This project has the potential to revolutionize the UAS industry by addressing the key limitations of traditional UAS propulsion mechanisms. The successful integration of IPS into UAS will herald a new era of sustainable, efficient, and maneuverable UAS operations. 

In addition to the aforementioned benefits, IPS-powered UAS could also offer significant advantages in terms of cost and safety. IPS systems are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and operate, and they pose a lower risk of fire or explosion than traditional UAS propulsion systems. These factors make IPS an attractive option for a wide range of UAS applications, including commercial deliveries, disaster relief, and environmental monitoring.

Design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for composite conformal tanks,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for composite conformal tanks (e.g., for hydrogen fuels)

As aviation moves to new propulsion technologies, fuels as well as airframes there will be a need to restructure the layout. The current tube and wing design has fuel tanks conveniently located in the wings taking advantage of the available volume as well as providing additional structural support. For airframes such as truss braced wings and blended wing bodies; propulsion systems such as high voltage hybrid electric and fuel cells;  as well as fuels such as hydrogen, it may no longer be feasible or desirable to maintain the current configuration. Conformal storage tanks are a potential solution as they can increase the packing efficiency in the available volume for odd shaped volumes. For maximum weight efficiency they need to be integrated with the airframe’s load carrying paths. This however poses design and manufacturing challenges. Odd shaped conformal tanks are not as amenable to conventional automated composite layup approaches as simpler geometries. This necessitates design compromises or the use of hand layup procedures which impact throughput, product consistency and ultimately the cost of new aircraft and transition to greener aviation. 

We therefore propose investigating manufacturing approaches for the design and manufacturing of 3D woven preforms for conformal tanks to provide both the structural support, fuel holding capacity and slosh prevention while meeting the constraints of the volume available in the new airframes. We propose utilizing high performance carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers as the primary reinforcement for the conformal tanks. Highly flexible, high strength CNT fibers with tight bend radii and high knot efficiency are amenable to automated 3D weaving into complex geometries. These geometries can be optimized for both the fuel carrying, and load path requirements for the conformal tanks. 3D weaving also enables building the structural supports for slosh prevention baffles in the preforms. CNT fibers are macroscopic materials assembled from a hierarchical arrangement of nanotubes.  While still in development, they are now available in lengths and strengths that have enabled demonstration of lined and linerless pressure vessels as well as structural panels for the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Office and other customers [1]. 

 Conformal tanks have a long history of use as a space saving design. In automotives, conformal tanks are used to store windshield-washer fluid and over-flow coolant from radiators [2]. They have also long been considered for spacecraft for their potential weight savings, volume use optimization and placement flexibility [2-5]. Aircraft, specifically military aircraft, have also used conformal tanks for extension of their range and more flexibility in mounting other payloads.  Manufacturing challenges have thus far limited their wider usage in aircraft (and spacecraft) applications. 

3D weaving of fibers has started to gain wider use as an enabling technology for creating complex shapes. An example is the Heatshield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) where, in partnership with industry, NASA has been developing Thermal Protection System (TPS) technology to enable landing of large payloads on other planets [6]. 
Combined, 3D weaving of CNT preforms for conformal composite tanks could lead to manufacturing friendly lightweight structures that integrate well into the airframe for greater performance and reduced environmental impact. 

 Specifically, we propose to investigate: 

Achieving the benefits of conformal tanks and structure in green aviation using Systems Analysis 

Approaches to the design and manufacturing of structural preforms made from 3D weaving of CNTs for tailored conformal tanks that meet the airframe requirements.

Mission-Optimal Aircraft Trajectories and Simulation Studies with Contrail Mitigation,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Mission-Optimal Aircraft Trajectories and Simulation Studies with Contrail Mitigation 

Air traffic is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming due to the formation of contrails via aircraft emissions. Contrails typically occur at or above 20,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and constitute about 35% of aviation’s global warming effects [1]. As the aviation industry continues to grow, the need for efficient contrail mitigation strategies may be required for greater environmental sustainability. Over the years, many contrail mitigation strategies have been developed which involve both heading and altitude changes [2]. These works often provide trade-off values between fuel consumption and contrail reduction. However, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is very little research over the impact of widespread adoption of such strategies on a network-wide, large-scale operation; existing works only consider strategies for a single flight. For instance, contrail mitigation strategies may lead to greater air traffic density especially with existing ATC (air traffic control) instructions such as holding, flow control, and demand-capacity balancing [3].Thus, the objective of this proposed study is to gain a better understanding of the effects of adopting any given contrail mitigation strategy on an existing airspace network. The specific aims of this study are the following: 
Develop a novel and efficient contrail mitigation strategy based on recent artificial intelligence and search-based techniques for simultaneous flights, rather than just one. 
Examine the aggregate impact a given contrail mitigation strategy would have on an existing airspace network within a simulated environment. Impacts can be measured in the form of sector demand or departure delay and will be assessed by comparing the use and lack of use of a mitigation strategy.

Direct Measurement of Charge Transport Mechanisms in Electric Engine Cabling for Coronal Discharge Mitigation and Current Mapping,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: Direct Measurement of Charge Transport Mechanisms in Electric Engine Cabling for Coronal
Discharge Mitigation and Current Mapping

Aircraft have traditionally used 28 volts for power distribution, but newer aircraft are beginning to use
270 volts. The first all-electric aircraft are using voltages of up to about 500; however, designers who are
looking at megawatt-class electrified-propulsion systems for single-aisle airliners propose up to 3,000
volts and up to 2000 amps.
At such high currents, buckles in cabling and defects in the conductor material can cause unwanted heat
sinks that can destroy cables. Also, high voltages in the reduced air pressure at the cruising altitudes of
commercial aircraft could lead to a potentially hazardous phenomenon known as partial discharge.
Partial discharge occurs when a current breaches the gap between two points with a voltage differential
across or through an insulation (micron level or smaller in size). These gaps, or voids, are typically air
bubbles within the wire’s insulation that occur during wire/cable fabrication. The voltage differential
between the two points creates an electric field inside the gap polarizing the air molecules within. As the
electric field grows stronger, the molecules within the insulation gap are more apt to collide and ionize,
that is, to become either positively or negatively charged due to the loss or gain of an electron,
respectively. Mean free path is the average distance a particle travels before experiencing a collision
(i.e., the average distance any air molecule in the insulation gap will travel before hitting another.) At
high altitudes (low-pressure), despite fewer collisions, the longer mean free path allows the particles to
accelerate over a greater distance and collide with significantly greater kinetic energy. These higher
energy collisions are more likely to facilitate ionization. So new cabling designs and insulation systems
will have to be developed to avoid such hazards.
Current state-of-the-art for high-current measurement breaking the circuit or magnetic induction
(NDG.io). Breaking the circuit at such high currents can add unwanted high failure connection points.
Magnetic induction technology measures the induced current produced by the magnetic field generated 
from cable current. While this a much better way, the induction method is too inaccurate (not greater
than 2%, 40 amp difference at 2000 amps) for aircraft precision, much too bulky to get between cabling,
and are only rated up to 600 amps. Much less than many MW aircraft are projected to require. Even if
all these issues for both methods could be solved, both approaches average out spatial variations and
therefore cannot distinguish the contributions of bulk processes and edge effects or defect-induced
contributions, which are of crucial importance to understanding local current densities in the cabling at
different points.
Current state-of-the-art detection of partial/coronal discharge utilize micro-sonics. One technique uses a
mini network of micro-acoustic cameras to digitally visualize the minute vibrations from breaking the
insulation (Flir). These devices allow a spatial imaging of the conductor and where the breaking is
occurring visually. Another technique uses opto-acoustic imaging through fiber optic cabling (Optics11).
These devices detect the acoustic emission signals of partial discharges and tracks their evolution over
time with fiber optic partial discharge (PD) sensors. The measuring principle behind the fiber optic PD
sensor is based on the acoustic emission technology. Both technologies are a bit expensive yet work well
at detecting partial discharges in high-voltage environments. However, both technologies require microvibrations of an insulation breach or beginnings of the discharge to have anything to detect. By this time
the cable would already be compromised and in need in need of replacement. This may be fine for an
electrical ground station but not an aircraft 30,000 ft in the air full of passengers.
This project aims to create very low SWaP, nano/micro scale magnetic field sensor to measure these
minute magnetic fields and field gradients created by the moving charges in aircraft cabling using ionic
defects in Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices as atomic-scale magnetometers. These sensors would be able to
detect currently accurately, but also determine current vector and deliver spatial current density
measurements. This would allow for accurate hot-spot detection in conductors well before an issue is
created. In high-voltage situation these sensors could measure buildup of charge due to voids or points
in high voltage insulation via their minute magnetic field gradients produced through moving charges.
This would allow for detection of an incurring PD well before it has begun and will allow for diagnosis of
what stage it is in well before the breach. This technology works by using the electronic resonance of an
electron of an implanted defect in a biased-SiC device as an absolute magnetometer. The magnetic
fields are measured as a perturbation of the electronic resonance of the system where magnetic field
intensity, vector, and current density can be derived. This work is early TRL, however, we have built an
initial quantum magnetometry apparatus and have demonstrated the ability to achieve resonance. An
acceptance from this call would allow for completion to the next steps in device realization for future
clean, green aviation systems monitoring.

High-speed thermometry tool development to assess alternative propulsion technologies.,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: High-speed thermometry tool development to assess alternative propulsion technologies

Obtaining temperature measurements within the high-temperature and high-pressure
environments of aviation gas turbine test rigs are extremely challenging due to their harsh
environment. Traditional instrumentation such as thermocouple probes do not typically survive
within such environments or are limited to wall-based measurements only. Laser-based, nonintrusive measurements are considered to be ideal within such environments and indeed their
developments within research laboratories have intensified over the past 2-3 decades. Nevertheless,
quantitative measurements within such environments often create their own challenges. An example
of such a measurement challenge would be solid tracer particles introduced into the flow for particle
imaging velocimetry or phosphor thermography fouling windows, thereby limited the life of the
experimental hardware and reducing the utility of such measurements.
Molecular-based measurements on the other hand, especially those that rely on the gas-phase
spectroscopic properties of targeted species, are ideally suited for such environments as they do not
require a physical probe or tracer particles. Among the different measurement tools available within
this category, the proposed work would develop high-speed (10-100 kHz), spatially resolved, 2D
planar temperature measurements of specific targeted molecules using planar laser-induced
fluorescence (PLIF). The targeted molecules would primarily be flame gas radicals naturally present
within the combustion chamber and downstream sections of alternative propulsion systems for
aviation. Such measurements can provide particularly rich insight within the flame zone, as different
radicals such as OH for hydrogen-air propulsion systems or NH for ammonia-air propulsion systems
can be targeted. Temperature measurements within such environments have the potential to provide
crucial insight into the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and other key pollutants, especially in terms of
their spatial distribution and temporal evolution. Furthermore, the NO molecule can also be directly
targeted for measurements of temperature and perhaps concentration using planar laser-induced 
fluorescence if enough NO were to be present in the flame gas (> 100 ppm). These temperature
measurements would be used by engine designers and combustion engineers performing CFD
simulations. Time-resolved measurements would enable the validation of modern computer codes,
such as large eddy simulations (LES).
The proposed work leverages recent developments in burst-mode laser and optical parametric
oscillator technology, including those supported by recent NASA SBIR and NSTGRO awards, to
facilitate such a temperature measurement at high repetition-rates. The state-of-the-art for such
measurements, especially within harsh practical environments, requires using two complex laser
systems simultaneously while being limited to a repetition-rate of 10 Hz. In contrast, the proposed
work utilizes the wavelength flexibility of the burst-mode laser with the wavelength tunability of the
optical parametric oscillator to provide a two-wavelength temperature measurement at 1,000-10,000
times the standard repetition rate. This proposal heavily leverages the state-of-the-art laser and
camera systems recently acquired by researchers in the Advanced Measurements and Data Systems
Branch within the NASA Langley Research Directorate. By utilizing the recent technology investments
already undertaken by NASA, the current proposal can provide critical support to improve the TRL of
this measurement technology so that it can be applied within areas of critical ARMD needs such as
green aviation. NASA programs supporting the next generation designs of gas turbine engines, along
with government collaborators such as the Department of Energy and industry partners such as
General Electric, would benefit from this temperature measurement tool development.

NASA is seeking sustainable solutions for aviation to achieve zero-emission beyond 2040. Electrification of aircraft is critical to achieve this goal. A key component for electric aviation, if not the most important one, is the energy storage device that is not only capable of powering the aircraft (i.e., high energy, high power), but also safe to fly. LI-air batteries are widely considered the most energy-dense energy storage platform yet the most challenging to develop. A Li-air battery pack has potential to achieve ultrahigh specific energy >1000 Wh/kg that is unattainable with any other battery chemistry. Successful development would be transformational and may enable 737-type short haul or even long haul electric aircraft. 
While NASA has several previous projects on Li-air batteries, they ended with either the lack of required performance metrics or transition opportunities. There has been recent refocus on aviation batteries, with substantial development in energy storage materials and deeper understanding in safe, high energy battery concepts. We herein propose, as a seedling effort, the re-invention toward a new generation of Li-air batteries. The objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the feasibility of combined use of solid electrolyte with holey graphene air cathode for high specific energy Li-oxygen batteries and to project a credible path toward the full development of a 1000 Wh/kg battery pack. The key aspects of our approach are: 
Explore the use of solid electrolyte instead of conventional liquid electrolyte in the battery cells. As such, the Li-air batteries will become non-flammable. 
With the use of oxygen from Earth atmosphere as the cathodic reactant, Li-air batteries are intrinsically the most sustainable option among all battery platforms.  
With our proven holey graphene air cathode platform (developed by PI) ultrahigh specific energy beyond 1000 Wh/kg at the pack level may be achievable.  
Successful execution of this seedling project would be the first step toward the most disruptive solution and the holy grail for aviation batteries that may enable 737-type large aircraft with all-electric propulsion, for which no other solutions currently exist.

High Efficiency and Low Noise Propeller Design Based on a Minimum Torque Solution,TTT,Green Aviation Solicitation,2023,,,"Title: ​High Efficiency and Low Noise Propeller Design Based on a Minimum Torque Solution​ 
A major goal of the ARMD SIP is enabling safe, quiet, and efficient vertical lift vehicles/technologies in strategic thrust 4. In order to reduce the environmental footprint of this soon to be expansive field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles, research into novel propulsion methodologies is needed. The traditional way of designing propellers through Minimum Induced Loss (MIL) was created by Betz in 1921 and has not changed to this day [1]. There is a new propeller design, proposed in NASA TM 20210014683, which optimizes based on the minimization of torque instead of MIL [2]. We received CIF/IRAD funding last FY to perform an initial proof-of-concept on this novel propeller design, and computational results from this funding have shown that the new design provides the same amount of thrust with a 2-3% reduction in torque (and thus a 2-3% reduction in power consumption) when compared to a modern (MIL) propeller with all the same characteristics except blade twist. Another highly desired quality is a reduction in noise due to the unique loading of the propeller. The Angle of Attack (AOA) at the tip of the propeller tapers off which substantially reduces the tip loading and large shear layer intensity and thus noise generation [3]. We were awarded 2nd year CIF/IRAD funding and have 3D printed these propellers out of titanium and plan to test them in the Low-Speed Acoustic Wind Tunnel (LSAWT) at Langley in Q1 FY24 in order to gather efficiency and acoustic data at the full range of advance ratios. Using TTT funding, we could extend our research by placing our novel (denoted “Prandtl”) and baseline (MIL) propellers onto an actual quadcopter, or fixed-wing subscale vehicle and compare the energy used during flight as well as the acoustic signatures between propeller designs. This could give us real-world evidence for the effective reduction in energy used in addition to acoustic noise generation which are two major improvements needed for the budding UAM field. This real-world evidence would increase the public and industry’s confidence in this new technology which would help it be implemented in real-world UAM vehicles. In the 2030-2040s timeframe, the use of VTOL vehicles in urban environments will rapidly increase and will become a large transportation industry with potentially large adverse effects to the environment in the future. The Aviation Climate Action Plan’s goal of reducing aircraft emissions by 2% each year for net carbon zero by 2050 could be realized in part by the 2% or greater reduction in energy use shown in our novel propeller design vs traditional MIL in vehicles designed for the growing field of UAM.

airports, airlines, and other organizations in the aviation industry will have to reduce emissions in a major
way. Our paper focuses on how airports can be designed to support future changes in the aviation industry
with a specific emphasis on two themes: airport sustainability and autonomy. Each theme is tied to our
airport innovations and guided our final design of the airport.
To start, we modeled our initial concepts on the Denver International Airport. The new technologies
we describe center around changes in aircraft formand fuel type, gate design, urban airmobility (UAM),
storing multiple fuel types, and autonomous systems. Even though our concepts are applied to the Denver
International Airport, we believe the designs can be generalized to other airports as well.
2 2050 Aviation Landscape
In 2050, we anticipate many changes to aircraft formand energy sources. We expect sustainable aviation
fuel to be the largest proportion of the fleet followed by lesser proportions of hydrogen, ammonia, battery
powered electric aircraft. We also expect aircraft formto adapt to new on-broad fuel storage requirements
where one possible change is to a blended-wing body design. It is also likely that we will see supersonic
commercial aircraft in the future. To support these aircraft, airports will require infrastructure changes in
their gate design, aprons, and fueling and baggage loading.
Societal changes and attitudes toward flying may also have an impact on our airport design. If flying
becomes cheaper and more accessible, then total air travel is likely to increase and in turn increase the
urgency for sustainable aircraft [29]. Similarly, increases in the cost of jet fuel may make alternative fuel
sources more attractive and speed up the transition. Expedited changes to sustainable aircraft may drive
faster development of fuel storage locations, more aircraft operations vehicles, and expansive terminal
layouts. If however, sustainable aircraft technology becomes costly to develop or support, then air travel
will increase in cost and drive compromises to airport upgrades e.g. only supporting battery-electric
aircraft and not hydrogen fuel.",,
Project ECOAir (Ohio State U),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2022,,,"
The timeliness and convenience of air transportation has led to billions of passengers utilizing air travel each year. Future advancements in aircraft technology will only increase industry appeal, causing a rise in air traffic and passenger rate. Although beneficial for airlines, this is a cause for environmental concern, as the aviation industry currently emits vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) between heavy flight traffic, nonrenewable fuel sources, and airport operations themselves. To prevent detrimental and irreversible environmental effects, changes must be implemented within the industry, including within airport operations.
Major airline companies and aviation contributors are working on plans for greener flight within aircraft design and fuel consumption, working toward the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Alterations of these aircraft are projected to greatly decrease harmful emissions and promote flight efficiency. The success and viability of these developments is largely reliant on airports’ ability to accommodate them with necessary infrastructure. To successfully fly with fuel-efficient engines, for example, commercial airlines first require access to adequate refueling facilities and timely turnaround processes that will ensure company profitability. If future aircraft changes do come to fruition, appropriate space and facilities must be ready to accommodate them.
Project ECOAir proposes a design that suits the estimated changes in aircraft while altering current ground processes. The concept aims to promote airport convenience and efficiency, aircraft accommodation, and sustainability. Accounting for the vast predicted increase in passenger rate by 2050, the bridged gate-pod design will disperse passenger activity to mitigate gate congestion and boarding complications. Subsequent open ground space will allow aircraft to taxi between gates and runways with ease, reducing ground traffic. The current complex and costly baggage transportation process will be optimized and transitioned underground, minimizing complications for both airlines and passengers. Several fuel options will be made available, and waste from processes such as deicing will be conserved. Ground support equipment will be mostly autonomous to improve safety and decrease turnaround time. Regarding the airport facility itself, clean energy and sustainable building materials will be utilized to decrease direct emissions.
By incorporating environmentally friendly technologies and reliable infrastructure, Project ECOAir’s airport will sustain efficiency in air travel to promote a brighter future of aviation.
Preliminary Research and Assessment
2050 Commercial Aviation Outlook
To perform an analysis of the expected aviation outlook in 2050, the current state of the industry must be accounted for. This includes an assessment of commercial aviation consumers, vehicle structure, energy sources, and current environmental status.
",,
Carbon Negative: A Modular Approach to Advancing Green Airport Infrastructure (U Penn),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2022,,,"The aviation industry has undergone several developments from its inception in 1903 to its
transformation in security measures in the post-9/11 world. In the next 30 years, especially as regular
travel operations resume post-pandemic, our research team anticipates a significant increase in the scope
of the aviation sector and a sizable increase in the number of passengers relying on commercial aviation.
As consumer and industry demands change, so will airport and airline offerings, which will revolutionize
the way we view the critical environmental consequences of this industry.
Following the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the aviation industry
has recently made major advances towards becoming more sustainable and efficient. From a commercial
manufacturer point of view, this is evidenced by the rise of ultra-efficient long haul aircraft such as the
787 and A350, which offer 25-30% less fuel burn and CO2 emission per seat over earlier widebody
airplanes1. These commercial and technological advancements have been accompanied by infrastructural
efforts to make airports more environmentally and economically friendly, such as solar panel installations
and green roofs. These advances have not only improved sustainability for airports and airline carriers,
but they have also helped expand routes and connect developing countries, which have limited funding
for airports, to global air transport networks. As a result, technological advancements that lead to
increased airline sustainability are also heavily economically incentivized both for governments and
commercial airline carriers.
Many experts and previous research have come to an agreement that airports’ carbon footprints
have the biggest impact on sustainability within the aviation sector.2 Aviation accounts for an estimated
2.5% of global carbon emissions3. More specifically, the ten largest airports worldwide generate an
estimated 127 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually4. In fact, According to E Terrenoire et. al,
carbon dioxide alone is expected to contribute to 36-51% of climate change caused by aviation in the
short-term, and to have an even greater effect in the long term due to the gasses' long residence time in the
atmosphere.5
As of today, airports and international organizations have set goals to achieve carbon neutrality by
2050, including 242 airports in the United States6. However, as of 2021, only four airports have met this
objective, including Austin-Bergstrom International airport7. We believe that in the next 30 years, it will
become necessary for all 242 airports to collectively produce and implement novel technologies in order
to become carbon neutral.
In this report, we will assess various carbon mitigating technologies, including the rise of electric
aircraft, the rise of electric support vehicles, and the use of advanced airport infrastructure, which will all
collectively help airports work towards carbon neutrality objectives by 2050. ",,
Bluebonnet Skies (UT Austin),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2022,,,"Carbon-neutrality in the aviation industry seems like a sky-high goal, but our Austin-based team is convinced it can
be achieved by 2050, even with down-to-Earth assumptions. We analyzed fuel policies in many of the world’s
largest economies and future aviation technologies to design an airport for tomorrow’s sustainable world. Our airport
is located in nearby Houston, which has a large, dynamic aviation market serving international, domestic, and
regional routes. Houston also has the added constraint of frequent flooding and hurricanes. Before diving into our
airport design and the research behind our decisions, we would like to justify a couple of key choices for tomorrow’s
airport.
For the primary fuels for these projected aircraft of 2050, we selected Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and electrical
batteries for their practical application. As SAF is currently in use, both governments and airlines have already
designed policies and infrastructure around them. Moreover, SAF and battery-electric planes receive the most
industry attention and investments. SAFs can be 100% carbon-neutral 1, 2, depending on how they are produced,
and reduce contrails by 70%3, significantly reducing the amount of heat trapped underneath an airplane’s path.
Battery-electric planes can be 100% carbon-neutral if they are charged from a sustainable source. Although
hydrogen and ammonia have recently received a lot of media interest, we have determined these technologies will
not be used in the aviation industry by 2050. These unattainable fuels have too many design concerns and
unrealistic expectations due to the need for significant infrastructure overhauls that most airports could not support,
sizable design challenges for current and future technologies, and lack of attention in the startup or established
aviation world. For instance, Airbus recently stated they do not believe hydrogen-powered planes will be possible by
2050.4
Aircraft of the future will look similar to today with the addition of narrow supersonic aircraft, blended-wing body
aircraft, and efficient small electric jets designed to carry heavy batteries. These new aircraft will impose challenges
on today’s infrastructure and were an important part of our investigation. Many airport terminals already have sunk
costs within their construction and private developers prefer to utilize and adapt their existing facilities rather than
completely discard them for a futuristic and financially unattainable airport. Accordingly, our futuristic airport design
is financially viable and is based upon reducing energy consumption, generating extra on-site energy for electric
planes and vehicles, and emphasizing flexibility to allow our airport to adapt to future changes in aviation.
Our design rests on three pillars - flexibility, transition, and reliability. Flexibility allows our design to adapt to future
technologies; transition makes our project trailblazing yet attainable airport that even dated airports can adopt;
reliability means our airport has additional system redundancies, where if one system fails another system will
automatically kick into action, without skipping a beat. In terms of power redundancy, the airport will be connected to
the local municipal grid with the addition of onsite renewable energy generation to ensure renewables are the focus
of energy consumption while assuring that the airport is not shut down due to unforeseen events that inhibit
renewable energy generation. Mega batteries, added over time, will store energy generated on-site. However,
because most of the airport’s open spaces support taxiways and runways, which are encompassed by obstacle-free
zones, only limited space beside the terminal structures and landside areas is set aside for sustainable energy
generation. As a result, our design showcases a transparent solar-panel roof above the electric aircraft gate areas
(Figure 4) and the installation of various vertical-axis wind turbines throughout the airport to exploit these underutilized
vertical spaces as seen in Houston Intercontinental terminal B (Figure 3).
",,
Aluminum Powder Combustion (Boston U),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2023,,,"This report addresses the challenge posed by NASA's 2023 Gateways to Blue Skies: Clean Aviation
Energy Competition for which our team must propose an alternative, zero or close-to-zero emissions
energy source. Our team has analyzed the carbon footprint of the production and combustion of
current-day jet fuel (Jet A), where it was found that the majority of emissions are produced during
combustion. The team decided that direct combustion of aluminum powder is the best alternative energy
source to meet the competition guidelines. Our team then compared aluminum powder to Jet A and
assessed the consequences of different combustion characteristics and aluminum nanoparticle diameters.
Overall efficiency calculations demonstrate that aluminum fulfills the energy density requirements while
also producing no harmful emissions except for aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and trace amounts of aluminum
nitride (AlN), both of which can be captured easily. Current aluminum supply chain metrics were
collected, analyzed, and compared to the team’s proposed close-to-zero emissions process. The entire
process of collecting raw material up to the powderization of aluminum is described, with the team’s
proposed changes being outlined throughout the paper. Modifications to allow for aluminum powder
combustion in current gas turbine engines are outlined and potential solutions and their current readiness
levels are listed in order to justify the feasibility of such changes. Increases in aluminum production and
infrastructural changes needed to keep up with the recycling of captured alumina is discussed, outlining
the aluminum production rates needed to reach the necessary fuel supply by 2050. The need for new
engine modifications, research and development, and infrastructural growth is shown in a timeline,
providing a general overview of when important milestones should be achieved.
The direct carbon emissions released from the team’s proposed process demonstrates a 96%
decrease without having to drastically change the current aluminum production process. The selection of a
set range of particle diameters allows for the aluminum powder to be safely handled without the worry of
combusting in air unintentionally, ensuring safe handling from start to finish. An analysis of previous
aluminum powder combustion studies, necessary infrastructural changes, and technological advancements
provides the team with a strong foundation to claim that the use of aluminum powder as a clean aviation
energy source is both feasible and viable by the year 2050.
",,
Aircraft Propulsion by Directed Energy Beam Bursts (UC San Diego),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2023,,,"Directed energy beaming is a promising technology solution for the pursuit of near-zero emissions in the
commercial aviation industry by the year 2050. In the context of sustainable aviation, directed energy
beaming involves the generation of a high-energy laser at an external power station, utilizing renewable
energy sources in the process. The laser is then aimed and beamed to an aircraft in flight, where its energy
is used either to activate photovoltaic cells to charge batteries that power propellers, or to power a “laser
turbofan,” in which the laser energy heats air that is then expelled out of a nozzle to produce thrust. Laser
power beaming provides airlines with higher energy density than solar power, 24-hour operational
capabilities, and increased payload or lighter aircraft, all while having the capacity to be generated from
fully renewable energy sources.
The team proposes the construction of ground-based laser beaming stations along popular domestic flight
routes within the next ten to fifteen years, powered with renewable energy sources such as solar,
geothermal, or nuclear. Once the viability of the technology has been proven, international government
entities can collaborate with private spaceflight and aviation industries to develop and deploy a series of
space-based relay and power satellites by the year 2050, thereby significantly increasing the system’s
range of support. Much of the necessary technology for such a proposal is currently available or in
development, although much work remains in terms of guaranteeing operational safety, garnering public
acceptance, and securing support from the spacefaring nations of the world. Nevertheless, the team
optimistically predicts that the aviation landscape of 2050 would not only support, but thrive under the
possibilities offered by laser power beaming technology.
",,
High on Hydrogen! (Manhattan College),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2023,,,"For the 2023 NASA Gateway to Blue Skies Competition, the team from Manhattan College has
elected to research the viability of hydrogen Fuel to power the commercial aviation industry in the future.
Moving forward, it is our belief that hydrogen fuel has the ideal combination of properties ranging from
energy density, to tremendous availability, to pollution-free use, for replacing jet fuel as the source of
energy for the next generation of passenger aircraft. This document will discuss the creation, storage,
transportation, process of loading hydrogen into commercial aircraft, climate impacts, safety, and
readiness levels.
Our research has revealed that in terms of generation, a combination of blue hydrogen and green
hydrogen, via biomass gasification and hydrogen electrolysis, respectively, is the best answer to meeting
the demand for hydrogen fuel in the near future. Looking forward, layered double hydroxide coatings on
electrolyzer electrodes hold the key to unlocking hydrogen production in an entirely green fashion, using
seawater as the main resource to fuel aircraft in coastal states’ airports. Meanwhile, the landlocked middle
states can rely on biomass gasification to provide their hydrogen fuel, as they produce much of America’s
crop and vegetation waste. Gasification will be performed in conjunction with carbon capture technology,
to repurpose the carbon dioxide byproduct to aid the photosynthesis process of future crops. The next
logical steps for the adoption of hydrogen as an alternative fuel are its storage and transportation. There
are many methods of possible storage for hydrogen; these include in a gaseous form or a liquid form,
which have the obstacles of needing to be stored at extremely high pressure and cryogenic temperature,
respectively. However, the most promising method of storage for gaseous hydrogen is bonding hydrogen
to a liquid organic hydrogen carrier, which results in an oil-like compound that can safely be kept at
atmospheric conditions. These obstacles pose a problem for transportation, especially with regard to
methods commonly used today to transport gasoline and other modern fuels. It is our belief, however, that
a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs, and hyperloops is
the future of hydrogen fuel transportation between production facilities and airports. Once the hydrogen
fuel arrives at the airport, it can be used to power planes in one of two methods, either powering electric
motors with a hydrogen fuel cell or used in a combustion process, similar to modern-day jet fuel turbines.
We propose using gaseous hydrogen for shorter flights (less than two hours) and liquid hydrogen for
longer flights (more than two hours) to benefit from the positive aspects of each phase of the fuel.
Research into the safety of hydrogen fuel proved that hydrogen’s low atomic weight, penchant for quick
dispersion, and need for high concentration to achieve combustion means that hydrogen is relatively safe
to use as a fuel source when compared to natural gas and gasoline. Finally, much of the environmental
impacts of hydrogen fuel come during its production. However, with the proper carbon capture
technology and usage of the stored carbon gasses in processes such as fermentation or use in the
photosynthesis of crops, much of the pollution can be mitigated. Looking towards the future, green
hydrogen production and the use of hydrogen fuel cells in aircraft lend to the belief that the coming
decades will see water as the only byproduct of hydrogen fuel adoption.",,
The Role of Hydrogen in Aviation Decarbonization (Carnegie Mellon U),UI,Blue Skies Competition,2023,,,"We are in a race to stop producing harmful emissions like carbon dioxide from every sector of the global
economy. Aviation is responsible for about 3% of these emissions,i and 2-3 times more people are
expected to be flying by 2050.ii This begs the question: how do we meet future demand and achieve what
NASA and the global aviation community have coalesced around, which is a goal of net zero emissions
by 2050, in a robust and equitable way? We believe that hydrogen is the answer.iii
This report begins by describing the levers that will help us achieve net zero aviation by 2050, including
hydrogen’s role in the broader decarbonization effort. It then describes the four stages of our proposed
hydrogen supply chain: making hydrogen, moving it via pipelines and trucks, storage near airports, and
last-mile delivery to the tarmac. Our vision is to connect hydrogen produced at the Department of
Energy’s Hydrogen Hubs with the nation’s 30 largest airports to minimize infrastructure costs and
maximize the impacted flight-miles. The report then presents a strategy for bringing the supply chain to
life by drawing on key lessons from transportation electrification efforts and offers a timeline that guides
stakeholders towards a future where 20% of revenue-passenger-miles are powered by hydrogen. Since
our proposal, we have addresses some of the most pressing questions about the transition to hydrogen
aviation, including social benefits (emissions reductions and environmental justice, safety, and green
jobs), key barriers (water consumption, public perception, and infrastructure barriers), and policy
recommendations (demonstrations, incentives, and regulations), informed by an optimization model
developed by the team, literature reviews, and additional stakeholder interviews.

2050 Aviation Decarbonization Levers
The aviation sector produced approximately 1.2 billion tons of CO2 in 2019. Several studies expect
growing demand for air travel to produce over 2 billion tons of CO2 annually by 2050 if a variety of
efforts are not employed. These efforts include efficiency improvements, the use of alternative fuels,
carbon dioxide removal, and purchasing carbon credits.iv The relative impacts of each of these approaches
in achieving net zero aviation is summarized in Figure 1.
Figure 1: A list of various efforts that will reduce aviation emissions to net zero organized from greatest to least percent impact
Efficiency improvements will be critical to reduce aviation emissions. The Mission Possible Partnership
estimates that over the past several decades, the aviation sector has improved efficiency by about 1%.
Moving forward, annual improvements of about 2% will be needed to achieve 37% emissions reduction
by 2050.3 60% of aviation emissions reductions are expected to come from using alternative fuel sources,
including batteries, hydrogen (H2), and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The market share that each fuel
type claims will be largely determined by the range it can fly. Battery electric planes are expected to fly
the short-range flights (<500 miles),v H2 planes may fly mid-range flights (500-1,600 miles), and SAFs
will likely dominate long-range flights (>1,600 miles).3
Although SAFs are expected to play the biggest role in reducing aviation emissions, they have two
significant downsides: (1) Burning SAFs still produces tailpipe emissions, with the best SAFs reducing
Jet A emissions up to 80%.vi (2) The production of SAFs requires vast quantities of land, water, and other
resources dedicated to producing feedstocks making a conversion to 100% SAFs unrealistic.vi Because of
their decreasing energy efficiencies and increasing carbon intensities, this team believes battery
electric planes should be adopted wherever possible, followed by H2 planes, leaving SAFs to fuel the
remaining furthest routes.
Finally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and purchasing carbon credits will likely play a role in achieving
net zero, although their roles should be minimized. These technologies allow airlines to continue
producing emissions and then spend money to directly capture carbon dioxide (CDR) or pay others to
remove carbon dioxide (carbon credits). In the pursuit of net zero aviation, this team believes the roles of
efficiency improvements and alternative fuels should be maximized, and CDR and carbon credits should
be viewed as a last resort.
Why Hydrogen
The U.S. finds itself in a race against time to minimize emissions across all sectors, and the clock is
ticking. H2 is a zero-tailpipe emission fuel that comes with numerous advantages:
Supply Chain Readiness
A significant amount of H2 infrastructure already exists in the U.S.: There are more than 200
steam methane reforming facilities,vii 55 H2 fueling stations in California,viii and approximately
1,600 miles of pipelines dedicated to H2 transport.ix As a result, the technology readiness level
(TRL) for H2 technologies is high across the traditional supply chain: gaseous H2 tube trailers and
2
pipelines, liquid H2 trucks, liquid H2 storage vessels, steam methane reformers, etc. While newer
production technologies, such as solid oxide fuel cells, are still around TRL 6, they are rapidly
advancing and approaching commercialization.x See Appendix Table 1 for more information.
Economy-wide Decarbonization
Several “hard-to-decarbonize” sectors – including cement and steel manufacturing, heavy-duty
transport, and shipping – are betting on H2 to help them reduce emissions. As more H2 is produced
to meet growing demand, all will benefit from reduced prices and strengthened supply chains.
Federal Funding Availability
The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will subsidize H2 production by up to $3/kg
through the mid-2040s.xi The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, dedicates $8 billion
to the mass production of H2 at H2 hubs across the nation.xii According to Princeton University
Professor Jessie Jenkins, this production boost will significantly drive down production costs over
time as private and public research advances and economizes electrolyzer technology.xiii
Aircraft Performance
Hydrogen-powered aircraft can go the distance. While aircraft powered only by fuel cells may be
more limited–Universal H2 and ZeroAvia’s preliminary fuel cell-only aircraft concepts have
expected ranges of 600 and 300 nautical miles, respectively–hybrid propulsion systems promise
to make even trans-continental flight possible.xiv,xv Airbus’ combination liquid hydrogen (LH2)
combustion and fuel cell aircraft have projected ranges of up to 2,000+ nautical miles.xvi
In-Flight Emissions Reductions
Aircraft powered by only fuel cells would theoretically eliminate all in-flight emissions, with the
potential exception of water vapor. Aircraft utilizing LH2 combustion would completely eliminate
the CO2 and particulate emissions associated with traditional aircraft but would increase the
quantity of water vapor emitted. The nuances of H2 aircraft emissions, including NOx, are
discussed in greater detail in the Appendix.
Hydrogen Supply Chain
Figure 2: The hydrogen aviation supply chain broken up into four sections: Make, Move, Store, and Last Mile
3
Our supply chain is divided into 4 stages: Make, Move, Store, and Last Mile. During the Make stage,
gray, blue, and green H2 are produced,xvii predominantly at the DOE’s H2 hubs. The vision is to connect H2
from an estimated 8 DOE-funded H2 hubs with a representative version of the FAA’s Core 30xviii airports
(the 30 largest in the U.S.). Appendix Table 2 lists the predicted hub locations that were used for analysis
in this report. Because investing in H2 infrastructure at each airport is quite costly, our strategy is to
minimize the number of airports that make the investment by focusing on the largest ones.
Once produced, H2 Moves from the H2 hubs to storage facilities at airports, either in gaseous form through
pipelines or as a liquid on trucks. We assume that each airport deploying H2 aircraft will Store H2 about
one mile away from the tarmac, likely at or near their existing fuel farm. The equipment necessary for H2
storage and usage will include liquid storage tanks, a H2 liquefier if gaseous hydrogen is piped in, and a
H2 refueling station if the airport adopts H2 fuel cell ground support equipment and/or buses. Finally, zeroemission
trucks will transport liquid H2 the Last Mile between the storage facility directly to H2 aircraft
that need fueling.
Our Plan to Scale Up & Policy Recommendations
To bring this supply chain to life, we offer a framework for integrating hydrogen into the aviation sector.
This paper draws on lessons learned from the Drive to Zero Program developed by CALSTART, a clean
transportation non-profit. So far, 26 countries including the U.S. have signed on to the Drive to Zero
Program’s Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) committing them to work towards 100% zeroemission
truck and bus sales by 2040.xix This section also draws on the proven policy framework
developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to commercialize low-carbon technologies.
After interviewing both CALSTART’s former Executive Vice President and Drive to Zero’s Global
Director as well as experts at CARB, the team identified five key steps to accelerating the deployment of
zero-emission technologies, from transportation to aviation.
Step 1: Set Clear, Unifying Goals
Explanation: The Global MOU started with a clear goal of 100% zero-emission sales by 2040
based on California’s Advanced Clean Trucks Rule and worked backward from there by setting
incremental benchmarks.xx
Aviation Application: Similarly, our team envisions the aviation community uniting around a
singular goal for H2’s role in the market by 2050 and working backward to achieve this goal.
Based on our research, setting the goal of 20% of revenue passenger miles (RPM) flown being
hydrogen-powered by 2050 seems ambitious yet realistic. xxi, xxii
Step 2: Fund Demonstration Projects
Explanation: After establishing a goal, the next step was bringing key stakeholders together for
demonstration projects. They emphasized that government funding is key to enabling
demonstration projects, and “once funding is available, industry will quickly follow.”
Aviation Application: In the case of aviation, this will include convening the largest airports,
major airlines, H2 aircraft OEMs, H2 producers and transport companies, the Federal Aviation
Administration, and nonprofits. The DOE is a likely funding source for aviation decarbonization
demonstration projects.
Policy Recommendations: Start with demonstration projects. While the Hydrogen Hubs
become operational in the mid-to-late 2020’s, we recommend the DOE administer a request for
proposals (RFP) for airlines to fly commercial hydrogen flights between two to three airports.
Ideally, these airports would be fueled by nearby H2 hubs. These demonstrations would take place
around 2035, providing several years to install infrastructure. Match funding by airlines would
4
likely go towards subsidizing the cost of the aircraft and hydrogen transport, storage, and
liquefaction infrastructure.
Step 3: Replicate Successes
Explanation: Once the initial demonstrations projects are operational, the key lessons should be
identified and replicated. They noted that “industry alone cannot push progress fast enough.
Government incentives and regulations are essential.”
Aviation Application: Best practices from H2 aviation demonstration projects should be paired
with incentives and regulations to accelerate H2 adoption at the Core 30 airports.
Policy Recommendations: After a successful demonstration project or two, then incentives
should kick in followed by regulations a few years later.
Incentives could subsidize the upfront cost of hydrogen aircraft, airport infrastructure
investments, and/or the price of H2 flight tickets (i.e., make hydrogen flights cheaper than
conventional flights to boost public interest). Interestingly, Universal H2, a leading H2
aviation startup, recommended subsidies go towards renewable electricity generation,
electrolyzer costs, and water desalination to benefit cross-sector low-carbon H2
commercialization.
Regulations could include an aviation-wide carbon tax or cap and trade system. They
could also include a phase-out of the sale of jet fuel aircraft similar to California’s
Advanced Clean Trucks Rule that gradually bans diesel bus and truck sales. Two
additional policy interventions that we recommend are reforms to speed up the permitting
process for energy projects as proposed by Senator Joe Manchinxxiii and federal guidance
towards approving hydrogen transport by rail.
Step 4: Education of Airport Employees & Public Outreach
Explanation: Public engagement is key to a successful large-scale transition.
Aviation Application: Airports are notoriously low-risk environments. For H2 to be effectively
integrated into an airport environment, both employees and the public should be well-educated
about how fueling, aircraft appearance, and safety procedures will be different for H2 than they
are for traditional Jet A fuel.
Step 5: Cultivate International Cooperation
Explanation: “Decarbonization is an international effort.”
Aviation Application: Expanding H2 aviation beyond the U.S. will help decrease costs for all
and increase the eventual likelihood of international H2-powered flights. The Carbon Offsetting
and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) already exists as a pledge between
countries to reduce aviation emissions and would provide a platform for H2 to become a part of
the global strategy.xxiv
Timeline to Success
Conversations with CALSTART thought leaders inspired this team to establish its own goal of 20% H2
RPM by 2050 to work backwards from.xxv Several H2-powered aircraft manufacturers, including global
OEMs like Airbus and startups like Universal H2 and ZeroAvia, are expected to bring H2 aircraft to
market between 2030 and 2035.14,15 In the meantime, several milestones must be achieved across the H2
supply chain to enable H2 aircraft to scale up rapidly once they are deployed. The team developed the
timeline below to help guide the transition. The national vision can be found as Appendix Figure 1.
5
Figure 3: Timeline of milestones to achieve 20% domestic H2 RPM by 2050
Optimization Model
To more robustly explore the nuances of a H2 supply chain, we developed a multicriteria decision analysis
(MCDA) model that is a mathematical representation of our framework. Our model finds the set of nondominant
solutions for supply chain configurations that balance the tradeoff between cost and emissions
with a series of real-world constraints. We derived three key findings from our model results, which we
summarize here and expand upon in subsequent sections:
1. Political initiative is needed to fundamentally minimize uncertainty surrounding costs, emissions,
and reliability of the hydrogen supply chain, offering better decision-making capabilities for
modelers and decision-makers alike.
2. Infrastructure development must account for both pipelines and trucks in the future aviation
hydrogen economy. In the near-term, trucks will likely dominate as a nimbler, cheaper
transportation option. In the long-term, pipelines offer a cost-effective, reliable, and loweremissions
option to deliver high volumes of H2.
3. For green hydrogen to play a more dominant role throughout the U.S., zero-emission electricity
generation prices will need to come down and novel regulatory strategies will need to be invented
to incentivize truly net-zero forms of hydrogen production.
Figure 4 below shows the final outcomes of our model which selected an optimized network
configuration for the four stages of our supply chain while balancing cost and emission objectives. We
varied the weight of these objectives (preference weights) with a term called alpha (𝛼) which ranged from
0-1; where 0 indicated fully optimizing for emissions; and 1 indicated fully optimizing for cost. In order
to account for variability within the network, we ran this model over three discrete cumulative distribution
functions for H2 demand which we called market capitalization scenarios.
This plot captures the opportunity cost of building the cleanest supply chain network––calculated as the
cost difference between the most and least emissive configuration––for each market capitalization
scenario. This information is essential to decision makers deciding how to configure the supply chain and
strategizing how hard to push for H2 penetration into the aviation fuel market. We see that for the base
case, the annual opportunity cost is roughly $60 billion (2050 USD); for the mid case, $146 billion; and
for the high case, $256 billion. This information is especially critical given that some industry experts
6
consider anything below 80% H2 market capitalization of domestic aviation fuel consumption by 2050 a
catastrophic scenario for the climate and industry as a whole. It begs the question of whether we will have
the political and social will to invest in the most carbon neutral future possible.

Supply Chain Logistics
Through extensive data collection and using some of the internal calculations of our model, we have
answered 4 Key Questions about H2 integration into the aviation sector for the 30 largest airports in the
country (representative of the Core 30). Production, transportation, and storage costs were estimated using
the quantities of H2 calculated under the 20% domestic RPM scenario detailed in Question 1. Additional
details, calculations, and the full list of the 30 airports analyzed can be found in the Appendix.
1. Is it realistic: Can the 30 largest airports in the continental U.S. alone be responsible for making 20%
of all domestic revenue passenger miles (RPM) be powered by H2 by 2050? If so, what percentage of
their yearly RPM would need to be powered by H2, and how much H2 does this translate to?
Yes, if the 30 largest airports each power about 27% of their annual RPM with H2 in 2050, H2 would
power 20% of total domestic RPM. This would require between 11 and 17 MT (megatons) of H2. A
conversation with an engineer at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) revealed that CARB
predicts a H2 hub in their state would produce approximately 16 MT/year of H2 by 2045. If these
numbers prove true at all hubs (or even close to true), then meeting 20% H2 RPM would demand less
than 15% of H2 hub capacities nationwide. As shown in Appendix Table 2, the H2 hub expected to
supply the most H2 to airports is the one located in CA, and airports would demand less than 10% of
this hub’s total capacity.
2. Fuel Cost and Emissions: What are the cost and emissions implications of each color of H2 in
comparison with Jet A fuel?
Thanks to generous IRA H2 production credits (up to $3/kg), blue H2 is expected to become cheaper
than jet fuel,xxvi and both green and pink H2 become cost-competitive with jet fuel. As technologies
like electrolyzers and small modular reactors used in making green and pink H2, respectively,
increase in production and efficiency, all H2 types may become competitive with jet fuel. We also see
that green, pink, and blue H2 emit less than 1/3 the emissions of jet fuel.

3. Transport Cost: What are the CapEx costs associated with procuring pipelines or trucks to connect
H2 hubs with airports? Are trucks or pipelines more cost effective?
Figure 6: Total CapEx costs for transporting H2 to three airports that demand different
H2 quantities: LAX (551 million kg), CLT (184 million kg), and IAD (102 million kg).
We find that it is likely more cost effective for airports to select one transport method for delivering
their H2 – either as a gas through pipelines or as a liquid via heavy duty trucks – since the
infrastructure complexities and CapEx costs required for each are so large. For the 30 airports
considered, we find that their annual H2 demand (under the 20% H2 domestic RPM scenario) can each
be met by one 36” dedicated H2 pipeline. Lastly, we find that the most cost-effective option for the 26
largest airports is pipelines, and that the remaining smaller airports should use trucks (see IAD in
Figure 6). This largely has to do with the quantity of H2 demanded at an airport and the distance from
an airport to its nearest H2 hub. See Appendix for additional details. Also note that while we analyze
battery electric trucks here, fuel cell trucks are rapidly improving and may be another viable option.
4. Storage Cost: Assuming a 25% on-site storage requirement, what is the CapEx cost associated with
on-site liquid H2 storage at airports?
At the highest H2-demanding airport (LAX), an estimated seven on-site 3,218 m3 capacity LH2
storage spheres will be needed at a cost of around $54 million. Spherical, as opposed to cylindrical,
storage tanks are used to store especially large volumes of LH2, and the dimensions and costs of those
used in this analysis come from the National Renewable Energy Lab’s Hydrogen Demand Scenario
Analysis Model (HDSAM).xxvii At the lowest demanding Core 30 airport (AUS), only 2 spheres
would be needed, for a total cost of around $15 million. These costs represent a lower bound, as they
8
only include the expected price of the storage spheres and associated piping and pumps, not labor or
licensing costs. While expensive, Pittsburgh Airport and LAX are currently investing $1.5B and $6B
in new terminals, signifying that airports are no strangers to hugely expensive expansion projects.
Social Benefits
Emissions Reductions and Environmental Justice
It has been shown repeatedly that the effects of climate change most often impact marginalized and lowincome
communities.xxviii Making H2 the clean fuel of the aviation industry will help to catalyze the
hydrogen economy which promises to bring decarbonization to many high polluting sectors. From an
end-use perspective, the benefits are universal. Airports with H2-powered ground support equipment (e.g.,
airport cargo loaders and wide-body aircraft tugs) and planes will make for cleaner, quieter airports––
reducing the pollution burden of flight operations on nearby communities.xxix
The benefits of production are not as clear cut. As Figure 7 shows, green H2 production is prioritized
under preference weights that prioritize lower emissions. These preference weights also correspond to
ranges for which the results of our model are most unconfident due to the prior-mentioned compounding
of uncertainties when 𝛼 < 0.3 and 𝛼 > 0.95 (see Appendix Figure 2). Our results indicate that for green
H2 to be more of a contender with blue H2 when optimizing for cost, the per unit cost of green H2 must
come down. Additionally, we find that in the presence of insufficient accounting of regional resource
constraints or emissions/equity priorities, federal optimization (e.g., based on cost) will result in
homogenous hydrogen production methods across the entire country. This may not equitably distribute
benefits of clean (green) H2. The result being that certain regions may be excluded or unintentionally selfexclude
from the larger green economy––retrenching distributional emissions harms.
Figure 7: Average quantity and type of hydrogen production over all probabilistic scenarios for the given priority weights. Green
hydrogen production is chosen for the most uncertain, emissions-prioritized regions. Pink hydrogen serves more as a transitional
method of hydrogen production. Blue hydrogen would be the most dominant form of production over a range of priority weights.
Safety
Another social benefit is that H2 is safer than jet fuel with respect to its impact on human health,
environmental safety, and risk of fires. Whereas direct exposure to jet fuel can damage the liver, immune
system, skin, and cause cancer, H2 is neither toxic nor carcinogenic.xxx From an environmental safety lens,
jet fuel can remain in soil for over a decade and leach into local groundwater. H2, on the other hand, is
likely to rise into the atmosphere and disperse because it 14 times lighter than air.xxxi Finally, H2 poses
less of a fire risk than jet fuel. H2 is less likely to ignite than fossil fuels because it requires significantly
higher oxygen levels and temperatures. If it does ignite, H2 fires pose less of a risk than jet fuel fires
because its flames burn upwards–rather than circumferentially–causing less damage to surroundings. H2
also radiates much more slowly which decreases the risk of H2 fires spreading to insulated components in
the case of an airplane fire. xxxii
9
This is not to say that H2 is completely safe. Safety precautions for H2 deserve serious attention,
especially because H2 leaks easily and burns with an invisible flame. Given that the U.S. has over four
decades of experience handling H2, H2 safety is not a new research area. Several organizations, including
the Center for H2 Safety and the Hydrogen Industry Panel on Codes, have worked together to create
robust H2 safety measures.xxxi H2 will likely be deployed in several new sectors over the coming decades,
which will require close monitoring and the advent of new safety measures. However, it is ultimately a
massive leap forward from jet fuel in terms of safety.
Green Jobs
The blossoming H2 economy will create vast new employment opportunities. These jobs will span the
supply chain, including areas such as CCS technology, electrolyzer and fuel cell manufacturing, pipeline
installation, and the multiple end-uses of H2. What truly sets H2 apart from other alternative aviation fuels
is that it will be deployed in so many sectors beyond aviation, including transportation, industry, and
shipping which means that the jobs created will not be niche - they will be highly transferable, long-term
employment opportunities that span multiple sectors.xxxiii
These jobs are already beginning to emerge. 20% of the application for the DOE’s Hydrogen Hub funding
is a Community Benefits Plan which requires applicants to consider labor engagement, workforce
development, diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and the federal Justice40 Initiative which ensures
40% of federal investments flow towards disadvantaged communities.xxxiv, xxxv Rather than recreate the
wheel, the aviation community has the opportunity to invest in H2 and scale up the green jobs already
being designed to lift up communities most in need.
Key Barriers
Water Consumption
The three H2 production pathways the DOE is funding through their H2 hub network–pink, blue, and
green–each consume significant water resources. Assuming the use of light water reactors, pink H2
requires the most water, approximately 76-85 gallons of water per kg H2 produced. Green H2 is not nearly
as water-intensive, requiring 19-28 gallons per kg H2, xxxvi because solar and wind do not require water to
generate electricity unlike light water reactors. Blue H2 requires the least water at 8-12 gallons per kg H2.
In this case, the water usage comes from several different sectors: the natural gas supply chain, cooling
tower, and electricity.xxxvii, xxxviii, xxxix
Based on the projected 2050 demand for H2 from the domestic aviation sector alone, we estimate the
maximum water required at H2 hub to exceed 88 billion gallons/year (see Appendix for details on this
calculation). This means states will have to allocate a significant portion of water resources to H2
production, a difficult task for regions with pre-existing water stress. One example of an already-stressed
state is California whose water demand exceeds 110% of available water supply.xl One potential solution
for California and similarly stressed areas is the desalination of rivers and seawater. Reverse Osmosis
(RO) has achieved a TRL of 9 with large-scale application globally, including 35% of Israel’s freshwater
coming from RO desalination,xli which demonstrates its ability to help address water scarcity issues.
Public Perception
Public acceptance of the use of H2 in aviation is an important factor that, if not addressed, can become a
barrier to commercializing hydrogen aviation. To understand the role of public acceptance of H2 projects,
we reviewed the work of Iana Iacob, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University focused on public
10
perception of the hydrogen hubs and hydrogen aviation. Without public acceptance, hydrogen projects are
at risk of facing pushback due to NIMBYism and environmental concerns. Numerous surveys indicate
that the public’s key concerns surrounding H2 relate to safety, regulation, and oversight. This applies to
all stages of the supply chain, meaning that the public would like to see safety guaranteed by regulations
and oversight for hydrogen production, transport, storage, use in aircraft, and CCS technology.
Research also suggests that the public is largely unaware of hydrogen as an energy carrier. This offers
hydrogen stakeholders an opportunity to craft the narrative surrounding hydrogen. We recommend that
hydrogen stakeholders and government proactively collaborate on hydrogen safety regulations over the
coming years so that when hydrogen demonstration projects begin, the hydrogen community can point to
existing regulations to help foster public trust. Regulation will specifically be key to enabling hydrogen
transport via interstate pipelines, the primacy to store CO2 underground for CCS technologies, and the
storage of H2 safe from attacks.
Infrastructure Barriers
Both pipelines and electric or diesel trucks pose their own unique challenges as H2 delivery methods.
Pipelines have much longer lifetimes and lower emissions per kg of H2 delivered than trucks. Despite
steep upfront costs, pipelines can be a very cost-effective option for delivering large amounts of H2.xlii
However, there has historically been significant resistance to the construction and installation of pipelines
spanning large areas, for reasons such as geopolitics, ecological damage, exploitation of Native American
lands, and drinking water contamination.xliii,xliv,xlv And even if a route was designed such that each of these
concerns were addressed, a pipeline can take up to ten years to construct.xlvi A Senior Director of
Operations at the San Diego Airport told the team that switching from delivering Jet A fuel on the tarmac
with trucks to an underground pipeline system caused huge disruptions and including gates needing to
close temporarily. Despite these drawbacks, there are over 1,600 miles of H2 pipelines already in
existence in the U.S., and pipelines are by far the most common delivery method of jet fuel to airports.xlvii
Trucks present a more flexible option. They do not require the permanent alteration of huge swaths of
land, eliminating the huge time sink of route design and licensing for pipelines. Furthermore, they can be
cost-effective options for customers who demand low to moderate quantities of H2, and some studies have
found them to be cost-effective (relative to pipelines) for longer delivery distances.xlvi, xlviii On the other
hand, adding trucks to the road increases congestion, which in turn impacts the safety of all vehicles on
the road, the quantity of vehicle emissions released into communities on roadways, and travel times. At
busy airports, increased traffic on airport-access roads and the tarmac could pose a concern to airport
operations. Furthermore, trucks delivering liquified H2 suffer from the “boil off” of LH2 where liquid H2
increasingly escapes over time. A representative of Universal H2 told the team that a possible solution is
to establish a strict window–4 days was suggested–in which H2 is delivered and used by aircraft.
Conclusion
Decarbonizing our economy is the challenge of our generation. If we are to minimize global warming as
fast as possible, we must coalesce around a unified and realistic decarbonization vision. H2 emerges
as a promising solution for decarbonizing aviation because it is projected to offer transcontinental, zeroemission
flights and is already supported by high supply chain readiness and federal funding. We find that
connecting the Department of Energy’s H2 hubs with the 30 largest airports creates a reliable source of H2
supply and demand that would both help achieve NASA’s 2050 net zero aviation goals and help spur
cross-sector decarbonization. H2 offers improved emissions reductions and environmental justice, safety,
and transferrable green jobs. By addressing its key barriers like water consumption, public perception,
and infrastructure challenges with proven policy initiatives, we believe H2 offers the best chance to
decarbonize aviation and the broader economy.",,

In addition to producing several novel superconducting electrical system components, the team plans to come up with a design concept that integrates these components and ideas into an aircraft similar in size and capabilities to a modern single-aisle, twin-engine airliner.

Under this program the team has banded together to form the Center for Cryogenic High-Efficiency Electrical Technologies for Aircraft, or CHEETA, to develop systems that may one day result in quiet, efficient propulsion systems that produce zero carbon dioxide and other harmful emissions.

Project Description
The aeronautics industry has been challenged on many fronts to 
increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and decrease dependency on 
carbon-based fuels.  With subsonic transports serving as the dominant 
contributor to the fuel consumption and carbon footprint of global 
aviation, the need for environmentally-responsible transportation has 
been met with a boom of research in the field of aircraft propulsion 
electrification across industry, government, and academic 
organizations.  However, adoption of electrified propulsion systems for 
large commercial aircraft today is unattainable, due to the lack of 
motors and power electronics appropriately sized for these vehicles, 
high weight requirements of conventional electrical energy storage 
systems, and new principles required to design these classes of 
aircraft.  The mission of the Center for High-Efficiency 
Electrical Technologies for Aircraft (CHEETA) program is to develop, 
mature, and design disruptive technologies for electric commercial 
aviation.  The associated technologies being researched include 
distributed aero-propulsion system integration, high-efficiency 
electrochemical power conversion, flight-weight electric machines and 
power electronics, materials and systems for superconducting 
high-efficiency power transmission, and methods for complex system 
integration and optimization.  Additionally, the current program is 
investigating the use of unconventional energy storage and power 
generation architectures, such as liquid hydrogen fuel and 
high-efficiency fuel cell systems.  The research program provides
 a direct line-of-sight to not only achieving, but potentially even 
exceeding the aviation community goals for transition to alternative 
propulsion and energy through convergence of various novel 
technologies.  The end result of maturation and integration of these 
technologies is an aircraft system with a quiet, efficient propulsion 
system that produces zero carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and 
particulate matter emissions at the vehicle level. 
Anticipated Benefits
Through this project, an entirely new class of electrical machines and drive systems will be developed, which can be applied to future electric aircraft or other markets such as wind energy, marine and ground transportation systems, remote power generation, and space systems. The research through this program on distributed propulsion and aero-propulsive integration will produce more energy-efficient commercial aircraft with improved safety and tolerance to failures.  Development of superconducting technologies will also facilitate dramatic improvements in power density of electric machines and ultra-efficient high-power electrical transmission.  Finally, the research being conducted through this study represents a brand new technology field which, if matured, will lead to US leadership in product development and export.",,
Electric Propulsion: Challenges and Opportunities (Ohio State U),UI,ULI Award - April 2017,2017,,,"The team will examine electric propulsion, including areas of battery and energy storage and thermal management, among others.

Project Description
This project will design, build, and test a 1 megawatt electric
 machine and thermal management system that is targeted for aircraft 
propulsion applications and achieves a specific power density exceeding 
14 kilowatt/kilogram (active mass) with 99% efficiency.  The machine 
will be integrated with its power electronics drive operating at 
voltages greater than 2000 Volt dc and achieving a 25 power density and 
99% efficiency.  The machine will be studied as part of an overall 
aircraft system which will include an energy management system.  The
 system integration work is led by Georgia Tech.  After first providing 
the initial requirements for the mission, they then resized the vehicle 
based on the preliminary technology goals.  Trade studies were performed
 and showed not only the benefits of distributed propulsion but also the
 contribution of the hybridization of the system on a regional 
aircraft.  A hybrid-distributed propulsion provided at 15% fuel burn 
reduction compared to a next generation A320 aircraft. With the addition
 of boundary layer ingestion (yet to be demonstrated) we can achieve a 
significant reduction of fuel burn and carbon dioxide emission of 23%.  Power
 electronics work is being performed at Ohio State's Center for High 
Performance Power Electronics (CHPPE) lab.  The team is developing 
advanced technology required to achieve high-efficiency 
high-power-density power electronics converters that achieve reliable 
operation with 2 kilovolt dc bus voltage in a harsh working environment.  Efforts are in 3 major technology areas:  Partial discharge study for power electronics and electric machines at low air density;Power module and power converter designs to achieve high power density;Advanced control strategies and protection schemes for aircraft onboard power  The
 work completed thus far has shown that the target power densities are 
achievable and most importantly that partial discharge at low ambient 
pressure can be controlled.  The focus on energy storage is to 
integrate the electro-mechanical thermal characterization methods with 
the performance, safety and durability of the battery cells.  The team 
at Ohio State's Center for Automotive Research is working with the most 
advanced cell producers to design and demonstrate novel Energy Storage 
System based on lithium-ion batteries and is optimizing the integration 
of these cells for the airplane mission.  The aim of this technical thrust is:   Characterization
 and modeling of high energy density state of the art and advanced 
battery technologies based on experimental testing, including energy 
density assessment, electro-thermal modeling, aging models, analysis of 
behavior at extreme conditions;Design exploration for high 
level pack sizing under performance, durability, cost and weight 
constraints (activity in collaboration with Georgia Tech);Battery
 Management System for pack control and safe operation, including 
dynamic power limits estimation of the cells considering temperature and
 aging, estimation of state of charge and state of health, safe 
operation at high voltage, cell balancing;Pack Architecture 
(modules and submodules) that enhances modularity, capability of 
reconfiguration and adaptation in case of fault, self-diagnosis, and 
operation with state-of-the-art charging infrastructures.  A
 high performing motor was identified early as one of the challenges of 
the program. A thorough integration of the mechanical and 
electromagnetic design were required.  The Center of Design and 
Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) at The Ohio State University was engaged
 early to work with the University of Wisconsin team to develop the 
motor.  The teams have worked closely to develop a well-integrated 
design could be made available first in a 200 kilowatt machine and then 
in a 1 megawatt motor.  The team plans to run the 200 kilowatt machine 
in the laboratory and the 1 megawatt machine at the NASA Electric 
Aircraft Testbed facility.  Thermal cooling for a high megawatt 
electrical machine is undoubtedly a major challenge.  The thermal 
management system is being addressed by the University of Maryland and 
North Carolina A&T State University.  New designs were investigated 
and the team kept close communication as to what was needed between 
these Universities as well as the University of Wisconsin and Center of 
Design and Manufacturing Excellence (CDME) at The Ohio State University 
as they worked on the development and production of the 200 kilowatt and
 1 megawatt reliable design.

"Advanced Aerodynamic Design Center for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles (University of Tennessee, Knoxville)",UI,ULI Award - April 2017,2017,,,"The team will research designs of ultra-efficient aerodynamic wings that could enable significant savings in fuel or energy consumption. 

Project Description
Led by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, the goal of this University Leadership Initiative (ULI) project is to demonstrate a viable aerodynamic wing-design concept that enables a 70% reduction in aircraft fuel/energy consumption relative to 2005 baseline for revolutionary and transformational aircraft configurations. This is being accomplished within a five-year project timeline to further the development and maturation of the slotted, natural-laminar-flow airfoil concept through both computational and experimental research activities. Evaluation of the impact of this advanced concept is being completed in all core areas of aeronautics, with specific consideration to aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, stability & control, and acoustics.
Research personnel for the Advanced Aerodynamic Design Center for Ultra-Efficient Commercial Vehicles is comprised of university faculty and students at six universities (Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Texas A&M University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Wyoming, and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville) and two industry partners (Airfoils, Inc. and Boeing Research & Technology). In addition to the achievement of progress milestones toward the project's research activities goals (development of design/optimization software modules, fluidic oscillator configuration tool, slotted, natural-laminar-flow wing geometry, wind-tunnel data, various reports and documentation), this ULI project is highly invested in providing quality, meaningful research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students within collaborating institutions. To date, more than two dozen college students have contributed on this project through research and educational outreach programming, which consists of the development and teaching of STEM-focused learning modules at local K-12 programs. as well as local Boys and Girls Clubs.

Anticipated Benefits
The primary focus of this ULI project is to support technology development that enables 100+ passenger aircraft to satisfy N+2 (mid-term) and N+3 (far-term) fuel/energy consumption goals. These aircraft classes represent over 85% of the current total commercial aircraft fuel consumption in the United States, a percentage forecasted to increase over the next several decades. The 100-210-passenger class aircraft, currently typified by single-aisle, transonic, tube-and-wing configurations, represents approximately half of the total fleet fuel consumption. Performance improvements and fuel-burn reductions for these vehicle classes have the largest impact on total fleet fuel consumption.

Recent NASA-funded concept studies at Boeing and MIT have yielded N+3 design concepts with 154- and 180-passenger capacities, respectively. In both design concepts, attaining natural laminar flow on the main wing is an enabling technology for meeting the performance goals. ULI research activities focus on the further maturation and system integration of the slotted, natural-laminar-flow (SNLF) airfoil, which is a potentially disruptive and revolutionary concept that shows great potential for reducing wing profile drag and enabling N+3-level performance gains for fixed-wing commercial air vehicles.",,

How might we employ AI to improve disaster response and humanitarian aid efforts?,CAS ,Discovery: Health & Wellness,,Medium,weather and disasters,"AI can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of disaster response and humanitarian aid efforts by providing real-time insights, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting decision-making in complex, rapidly evolving situations. Machine learning algorithms can analyze satellite imagery and social media data to assess the extent of damage and identify areas most in need of assistance. AI-powered predictive models can forecast the spread of infectious diseases or the likelihood of aftershocks following an earthquake, allowing responders to prioritize their efforts. Autonomous vehicles and drones equipped with AI can deliver supplies and conduct search and rescue operations in hazardous or hard-to-reach areas. By harnessing the power of AI, humanitarian organizations can respond more quickly, allocate resources more effectively, and ultimately save more lives in the aftermath of disasters.",,

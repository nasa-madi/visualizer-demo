How might we eliminate carbon emissions with High-temperature PEM Fuel Cell for Aviation?,Wicked Wild,High,"Opportunity: 1) To eliminate CO2 emission 2) To triple energy efficiencyCO2 production by hydrocarbon fueled aircraft that contributes to global warming is expected to triple by 2050. Continuing to fuel aircraft with hydrocarbons is not sustainable. 
Replacing hydrocarbon fuel with H2 eliminates CO2 emission. Joint NACA/NASA - Air Force projects Bee and Suntan successfully flew a B-57B twin-engine bomber using liquid hydrogen (LH2),  and successfully fueled MW-scale aircraft engines (CW J-65 and P&W M304) using LH2 in the 1950s.
Because LH2 volumetric energy density is 25% of jet fuel, H2 powered aircraft requires a much larger fuel tank. Replacing the combustion process with higher energy efficiency fuel cell electrochemical reaction may offset the lower LH2 energy density. The current PEM fuel cell energy efficiency (~50%) is ~2X an internal combustion engine. The estimated efficiency of high temperature PEM fuel cell (HT PEM FC) is >70%. The DOE is developing HT-PEM technologies for heavy duty vehicles but excludes considerations specific to aviation. 
""Wicked-Wild"" Idea: Develop HT-PEM technology for aviation
Using HT-PEM fuel cells to power electric aircraft eliminates CO2 emissions while sustaining timely, long-distance travel capability. 
Develop HT-PEM fuel cell materials specifically for aviation 
Focus on membranes, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEA)
Include other stack components as opportunities allow
Test HT-PEM fuel cell materials, single cells, and cell stacks under aviation load profiles (high-power flight condition for take off and climb, low ambient air temperature and very dry air at high elevation, etc.)
Demonstrate HT-PEM FC energy efficiency and CO2 emission reductions","the pitch is high temperature PEM Fuel cell for aviation.
Flying Airplane takes a lot of energy. Burning hydrocarbon fuel is not efficient way of getting the energy.
It causes pollution and release carbon dioxide into the air, which causes global warming. This presentation tries to address both of the problem, low efficiency of conversion and the global warming, the efficiency of electrochemical energy converging by fuel cell is much higher than any account conversion process for high temperature PCL the efficiency is 3 times of that for combustion engine. Fearing feeling a few cell with hydrogen eliminate carbon dioxide emission and combustion by product that causes air pollution.
When you hydrogen in a turbine engine can't also power an airplane without carbon dioxide emission.
However, the efficiency is low and it emits nitrogen oxide.
The prototype, the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen, is about 1/4 of hydrocarbon fuel.
The low efficiency of burning hydrogen means a much larger fuel tank and or a short flighting distance.
it is the importance into the air and contributing to global warming, the high energy efficiency of fuel may offset the lower energy density of hydrogen.
Therefore comparable few compare size of fuel tank can be used for similar flying distance of country airplane. You're placing.
Engine with a highly efficient fuel cell is a great option.
It means the size of fuel tank and the frying range of current airplane and also completely eliminated the imaging their causes, global warming and protect air. The Department of Energy is developing high temperature paint fusia for ground transportation, especially for heavy duty vehicle.
The pitch this piece is for developing the similar technology for aviation.
The developments are where you focus on material specific for aviation application, such as membranes, electrodes, membrane electrode assembly and other stack components to measure the progress of this activity.
High temperature pain, fuel cell stacks and system will be tested under the aviation load profile. The result will be used to modify and optimize fuel cell system for aviation application.
The results are important for the design of future policy system for electrified, electrified airplane."
How might we employ AI to optimize resource allocation and reduce waste in various industries?,Health & Wellness,Medium,"AI can play a crucial role in optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste across various industries, from manufacturing to agriculture to energy. By analyzing real-time data on production processes, supply chains, and consumer demand, AI algorithms can help businesses make more informed decisions about how to allocate resources efficiently. This could involve predicting equipment failures and scheduling preventive maintenance, optimizing inventory levels to minimize waste, or dynamically adjusting production lines to meet changing market demands. AI-driven resource optimization could lead to significant cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and improved overall operational efficiency for businesses.",
How might we use AI to improve healthcare diagnostics and treatment planning?,GeoEngineering,High,"AI has the capacity to transform healthcare by assisting medical professionals in making more accurate and efficient diagnoses and treatment decisions. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of patient data, including medical records, imaging scans, and genetic information, to identify patterns and correlations that may be difficult for humans to discern. This could lead to earlier detection of diseases, more precise diagnoses, and personalized treatment plans based on a patient's specific health profile. Additionally, AI-powered tools could help streamline clinical workflows, reduce medical errors, and provide decision support to healthcare providers, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.",
How might we harness AI to enhance public safety and security?,GeoEngineering,Low,"AI has the potential to significantly enhance public safety and security by enabling more effective monitoring, prediction, and response to potential threats. Computer vision algorithms can analyze video footage from surveillance cameras to detect suspicious activities or individuals, while natural language processing can monitor online communications to identify potential security risks. AI-powered predictive policing tools can analyze crime data to forecast where and when crimes are likely to occur, allowing law enforcement agencies to allocate resources more effectively. Additionally, AI can assist in emergency response by optimizing resource deployment, providing real-time situational awareness, and supporting decision-making in high-pressure situations.",

How might we minimize crash landing drones and air vehicles?,Wicked Wild,High,"Provide redundant landing capabilities to UAVs to increase safety and public confidence in these systems. This will allow the economy to expand with the capabilities UAVs promise while managing the risks associated with their overflight of valuable assets and humans. We can take the next step to build on the success of Safe2Ditch intelligent landing system by adding backup propulsion and guidance to increase the options for a safe ditching and more precisely control the crash and mitigate damage/injury. Perform a analysis of available electric, pressure, 
and rocket powered systems that can be added to drones to supplement 
damaged systems and controlled by the Safe2Ditch system to expand its 
ability to reduce the danger from ditching UAVs",
How does climate change and severe weather events impact the % of airspace that is navigable by aircraft?,GeoEngineering,Low,,
"Assuming that the commercial trend towards hospital consolidation and specialization continues and patients are farther away from advanced treatments, how might aviation impact accessibility of healthcare? (See: medical staffing, changes in healthcare business models, Direct-to-consumer health apps, travel nurses, etc.)",Health and Wellness,Medium,"Sources:

Problem Scoping: 
Two divergent Healthcare Scenarios: 
Medical treatments become cost-effective enough to move to or stay in local hospitals, lessening the need for travel. 
Medical treatments become less cost-effective (or some do) to the point that treatment centers consolidate and are farther away from patients on average. This is the more likely scenario given the trends in health-apps, investing, travel nurses, minute-clinics, hospital funding problems. 
Given scenario (2), there are two Aviation Scenarios: 
Personal Air mobility or commercial aviation drops in cost sufficiently to counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Medical treatment (tools/supplies) become small enough and cheap enough to ship TO the patient, possibly by air (air hospital?) and counter the increased cost of healthcare. 
Sub Problems: 
Does the shift to outpatient clinics reduce the availability of hospitals offering complex procedures and put greater need on air travel for the critically ill? 
Population is more distributed (remote work), so will more people be farther away from centralized services that cannot be financially solvent in closer facilities? 
Will the advancement or cost-efficiency of treatments drop enough to distribute healthcare to local clinics? 
Why is this a problem? 
As medical health care technology becomes more advanced, the cost of health care more expensive, and population more widely distributed, aviation may have an increasing effect on the accessibility of health care. 
What capabilities may be needed to address the problem? 
Aviation can provide services in the future that are presently either centralized or provided by a range of other transportation. The challenge will be to right-size and optimize the aviation capability to the needs of the health care problem. 
Transportation of medicine via UAVs with appropriate temperature/atmosphere/humidity control which can provide timely delivery, 
Airborne ambulances that can transport while providing care. 
Transportation of medical equipment to remote areas (on a rotation? As part of a pre-planned schedule?). 
Miniaturization of health tech 
More temp-stable medical goods that can survive rougher transport. 
What trends might enable problem exploration and solution? 
A broadening of capabilities in aviation ranging from the advent of personalized air vehicles to package delivery UAVs allowing a series of options for both human and package delivery; 
Increasing level of capabilities due to technical advances allowing more localized and effective health care. These trends are counterbalanced by ever increasing healthcare costs that may limit patient access. 
Telehealth – making people more comfortable with remote healthcare 
Robotic Telehealth – letting doctors stay where they are but keep robots local for surgery, etc. 
Cheaper diagnostics - reducing the need for travel to find out if you have a problem, reserving travel to treatment.’ 
Medical Tourism – will the cost and accessibility of medical tourism counterbalance the need for rural access. 
Reach - How many people, communities are going to be impacted or are impacted by the problem? 
This is ANOTHER way that discrepancies between rural vs urban healthcare is mitigated by aviation. We scoped this to 100M because we believe that smaller procedures will become more accessible/local, but not ALL procedures. So globally, we believe that 100M people will be impacted or make decisions about treatment and safety based on access and cost. 
Impact - What is the scale of the impact? 
Score: 4-5 Majority 4 (given the costs and advanced nature of the treatments), but small percentage will be 5s, where care is absolutely critical to immediate survival. 
Confidence - How confident are we in the impact and reach determinations? 
We are assuming that the geographic consolidation of healthcare continues to the point that access is reduced. If that trend continues, we are confident aviation will be a greater player in access. If not, the question is moot. 
Effort – what is the effort/scale needed to address? Wickedness? CAS-worthy? 
It is suggested that this is a CAS-worthy problem. It is Wicked covering technical, political, societal, economic, and legal issues. It directly involves aerospace across the spectrum of vehicles. The range of technical challenges related to this topic are formidable spanning the range of NASA technologies. Other players in the market may influence parts of the system, but no one technology or solution can mitigate the entire issue of rural access. ",

What is the problem or need?

Ubiquitous Sensing
Technology advances generate an environment of ubiquitous monitoring both on a personal and societal level. 
Personal health monitoring: watches, phones and XR allow users to be informed regarding their heart rate, oxygen level, stress level. Privacy concerns arise related to use of personal information
Wearables hacking - how can we trust the data and protect the users?
There are also remote medical sensing technologies that could be as ubiquitous as CCTV, and even drone-mounted.

<Scenario>
(gpt-4) 
In the not-so-distant future, we find a world grappling with the consequences of climate change, the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), and the increasing capabilities of surveillance technology. These global challenges and opportunities touch everyone, yet they disproportionately impact communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which often bear the brunt of climate change effects and are least equipped to adapt to or influence AI and surveillance technologies.

Imagine a coastal community in one such LMIC. The rising sea levels, a direct consequence of climate change, threaten their homes and livelihoods. However, their voices are often unheard in international climate policy discussions. Their limited resources and access to technology make it hard for them to adapt to these changes or participate in mitigation efforts.

Meanwhile, the world around them is becoming increasingly digital. AI systems are transforming economies, Surveillance technologies are becoming ubiquitous, and wearable devices that could help detect and warn of disasters are out of their reach due to economic constraints. These communities are at risk of being left behind or, worse, exploited as the world around them transforms.

This scenario is not just a possibility but a reality for many communities around the world today. The ethical impact of these changes is significant and global, affecting billions of people. The aviation industry is uniquely positioned to influence these challenges, from contributing to climate change mitigation to leveraging AI for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.

However, there are significant gaps in understanding and addressing these problems. For instance, we need to ensure that the benefits of AI and surveillance technologies are equitably distributed and do not infringe on human rights. We also need to involve the most affected communities in climate change solutions and ensure their voices are heard.

The potential impacts of these issues are well known, but the specific outcomes and how they will evolve are uncertain. As we navigate this future, we must be proactive in addressing these ethical considerations and strive for a world that is not only technologically advanced but also equitable and inclusive.",
